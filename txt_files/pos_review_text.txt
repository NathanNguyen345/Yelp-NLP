評価がとても高いこちらのレストランでブランチを予約しました
2時半に予約し伺ったのですがこの時間帯なら予約なしで入れそうです

まずはビールで乾杯
そとは暑いので本当に美味しい

メニューは下記をオーダー
onion soup

ゴーダチーズサラダ

エスカルゴのオーブン焼き

steak

それに合わせビールの後は白のオススメのグラスとお肉に合わせた赤ワインを出して頂きました

料理はどれも美味しくてうっとり
またそこにワインの相乗効果で最高な時間を過ごせました
外のテラスに座らせてもらったのでベラジオのホテルの噴水も良く見えて良かったです

now said say always crave ribeye steak slathered deliciously sweet bordelaise sauce visit vega load steakhouse pretty much everywhere price point steak great value well great taste slightly fatty beefy richness cooked exactly love medium rare imho steak menu order lesser priced steak alright buck ribeye 

if havent tried goat cheese tomato sauce appetizer super tasty creamy goat cheese melt tomato sauce fortifying amazing flavor come slab garlic butter soaked bread kind greasy opted hot fresh baguette frisée kale bacon salad make awesome salad thats covered single poached egg know put warmed egg yolk anything itll taste good dressing nicely acid slight sweetness cut bacon egg richness good

who know maybe supposed standard gone perhaps perhaps good food good food matter come regardless case one doesnt need act like arrogant bitch itthis place great considering pricy restaurant tend strip mon ami gabi great deal price location right across bellagio fountain 

we made reservation using open table via yelp seated inside right next window able see fountain little late breakfast still took friend order omelette ended getting apple chicken brie panini friend went egg benedict thought food environment great baguette delicious really enjoyed paniniscarfed whole thing definitely returning breakfast lunch next time im vegasmon ami gabi definitely thumb breakfastbrunch self serve bloody mary bar mix drink didnt actually order bloody mary menu however thought nice touch patron option

schon wegen de fantastischen panorama sollte man einen tisch auf der außenterrasse wählen reservierung empfehlenswert denn dort bekommt man gratis zum essen und trinken lebendiges kino im superformat da quirlige leben auf dem strip und vor allem de nachts da viertelstündliche schauspiel der von musik untermalten fontänenchoreografie httpwwwqypecomplace228958fountainsofbellagiolasvegas de bellagiosees
doch zurück zum mon ami gabi wer hier speist sollte nicht unbedingt die alibiangebote amerikanischer küche wählen wie burger oder ähnliches wer da wählt outet sich al genussbanause davon scheint e jedoch einige zu geben dabei ist da angebot gehobener  französischer  küche verlockend und man sollte sich dem ruhig hingeben wir jedenfalls wurden nicht enttäuscht
vorab chicken pate und country pate je  995 anschließend lamb shank  2695 und steak bordelaise  2595 zum dessert profiterole  795 die flasche morganwein kostete  47 und schmeckte vorzüglich über 80 verschiedene weine werden angeboten da fällt die auswahl schwer aber man kann auch den wein glasweise bestellen wine glass und ein wenig die vielfalt testen
erfreulich für kinder gibt e ein spezielles kindermenu

why 4 star rather 5 love hanger steak love hanger steak even one strand fiber quietly cut length steak cooked becomes virtually impossible remove without mincing whole piece  floss one item tsa still let take plane id dont need steak two quick slash gone easy vastly improve anyones enjoyment dish

given opportunity id definitely come back dinner

great view bellagio fountain salmon egg benedict amazingmon ami gabi est un resto touristique mais très bon 

on ne savait pa trop ce que lon voulait diner sur le strip et sest dit que diner en face de fontaines du bellagio pourrait être sympa de plus la carte nest pa extrêmement cher comparé aux autres restaurant autour 

la carte présente beaucoup de plat français ainsi que beaucoup de vin français pour avoir essayer la soupe à loignon ainsi quun truite nous étions convaincu  la qualité est là 
de plus nous avions du pain et du beurre pour patienter le dessert typiquement français sont délicieux la crème brûlée fut parfaite

lambiance est romantique retrouve un peu lambiance de certains bistro haut de gamme de paris il est possible de manger à lintérieur à lextérieur et ainsi que dans la véranda il de parasol chauffants pour lextérieur lorsque la fraicheur du désert sinstalle 

le service fait un peu usine le serveurs installent le convives aux table quils leur sont attribués par radio mais une fois installé et que son serveur attitré soccupent de nous tout va bien 

pour ceux qui veulent manger français à vega sans pour autant dépenser une fortune ce restaurant est tout à fait correctcame surprise boyfriend birthday 
well say decor view worth romantic disappointed

the reason taking star seating policy

id give 5 star except following reasons
1 slightly noisy side busy 10lane la vega blvd s
2 take hour get seated outside due popularity
3 waiter friendly personable especially one guy called kareem moody waiter french restaurant unpredictable snapped unkind way simply telling ready order hurry hurry waited 80 minute sit well many customer guess must overworked kareem none business far concerned still need treat valued customer dont deserve given attitude front lady restaurant cost 60 per person

the smoked salmon presented well tasty ingredient fresh arranged way diner easily craft smoked salmon canape fixing overwhelmingly fishy flavor smoked fish mild savory slightly sweet buttery texture 

my boyfriend ordered steak bordelaise filet mignon creme fraiche omg steak cooked proper temp fair price quality portion ratio 

all badyummm 

so last 2 time ive vega ive eaten place first time brought cold tofu classmate recently moved area nice french style steakhouse serf steak sandwich seafood like walking really reminded wonderful time france amazing journey seriously took home 

the first time tried french onion soup moulesfrites escargot

now must say since walking place brought back many intense memory happier time really setting bar high food maybe little high compare dish tried france must say food mediocre best 

the french onion soup definitely wayy salty consumed without amazingly fresh bread brought table asked bread 6 time throughout meal every time came fresh outta oven piping hot thats bread  plus side youre poor college student coming vega party want slice good life could always come order bowl french onion soup dip bottomless bread would definitely get full letting basque french ambience saying 

my mussel also tad fishy side sauce bit salty liking fry outta world deeelicious  although must say definitely french style frites fry sliced thinner usual crispy around stay way throughout whole meal  even 3 hour later back room planet hollywood  

my escargot also saltier side seriously used smoke definitely dont eat food bland everything ordered salty taste somethings gotta give think like help cover unfresh aroma actual snail thats bread came handy  herb butter sauce escargot prepared super flavorful handful many pinch salt needed super carb bread help soak up

that night friend brought ordered steak bearnaise recommendation one favorite france along steak roquefort nommm bearnaise bit thin flavor spot came side amazing frites complete meal

just month later decided take fam lunch labor day weekend wasnt wait amazing saturday 12  seated u bright dining area open window ac blasted high  felt great able seated outdoors without 100 degree plus weather

the menu different lunch suppose  entree lot lighter salad sandwich choose ordered tuna melt steak sandwich bacon cheeseburger caesar salad every sandwichburger came order delicious fry  believe sandwich stood among choice would steak sandwich flavorful steak tender side au jus dip right amount kick  believe grainy mustard made difference  caesar salad total disappointment believe literally 8 bite overdressed salad 10 could added another 2 got another burger sandwich definitely never order salad form would much happier wendys caesar side salad 1  thats bad

thats crime  menu make mention gf french toast option  seriously folk one wife favorite breakfast world menu doesnt even list  note  dined yesterday waitress mention staff meeting menu change said would push making wonderful option obvious customer special diet needs

my egg benedict always good mind blowing egg always done perfectly  1 id take upgrade smoked salmon canadian bacon maybe thats  side bacon four strip  crispy little thick  biting little like eating beef jerky good way seems light maple glaze it

its bustling place usually town weekday  id imagine wait horrific weekend  usually book opentable reservation walking short 5 minute wait spend waiting line talk hostess  im sure folk saying overlook bellagio fountain  one time show time always seems one billboard truck blocking view  id say watching bellagio fountain show almost like watching flatscreen tv home

the staff always running around good tiny coffee cup sometimes need filling faster getting mine refilled  wife get stuck hotel room conference call pack thing togo nicely letting earn great point husband providing french toast room service

fourth time say disappointed food service perhaps cause one individual u friend assistant manager seemed ignored waited well others service lunch erratic inattentive though restaurant busy previous meal wanted try quiche impressed dry little flavor bland  boyfriend meal better believe steak kind pretty dry even though pay meal value nearly good value past time 

from experience would still highly recommend restaurant expensive french restaurant place honestly great price discouraged one bad meal would say  great ratiolong wait patio totally worth seated 45 min busy saturday afternoon right next busy street

apparently hot ticket dinner item beef bourginione order next time vega love beefdas mon ami gabi ist definitiv einen besuch wert wenn man vega auf der suche nach unfrittiertem essen oder gehobener küche ist die wartezeit betrug für un wir waren zu zweit 15 minuten die wir mit einem piepser ausgestattet im casino verbringen konnten somit kann man die zeit zumindest sinnvoll nutzen und seinen kontostand aufpolieren  der vollständigkeit halber sei erwähnt das diese wartezeit nur für die terrasse galt im innenbereichen de restaurant hätten wir umgehend einen tisch erhalten

das ambiente im restaurant selbst empfanden wir al recht drückend schummriges licht dunkles mobiliar auf der terrasse hingegen hat man perfekte sicht auf die wasserspiele de bellagio gegenüber

der service war sehr angenehm und zuvorkommend al appetizer gab e ofenfrisches baguette butter und einen kleinen gruß au der küche 
die hauptgerichte welche wir au dem vielfältigen angebot wählten ragout vom wildschwein auf selbstgemachten nudeln sowie hühnchenpaillard auf einem basilikumrucolapüree waren ausgezeichnet und geschmacklich sehr ausgewogen eine erfrischende abwechslung zu burger und pommes

hinsichtlich de preises für eine abend im mon ami gabi kann man sagen ja die preise sind höher wenn man sie mit den meisten fastfoodrestaurants strip vergleicht allerdings bekommt man dafür gehobene kost von hervorragender qualität rundum guten service und einen wunderbaren ausblick auf der terrassegreat environment great food great service
