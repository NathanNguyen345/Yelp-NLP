overall
food 710
service 210i wanted love mon ami gabi ala meant steak average herb butter pomme puree salty rendered rest dish inedible french green bean delicious fresh bread among best ive ever 
our server great sweet attentive food mediocre awesome waitress couldnt quite save mealgot seated family dinner friend server friendly helpful ordered steak delicious fry thin tasty kinda reminds outcouldnt stop eating fry steak good well remember anything else nice seating outside strip eat watch people would recommend placefrench food usually awesome  mon ami gabi good restaurant serf good french food wouldnt go way come vega  live boston every french place ive better mon ami gabi  french place duck menu  never seen  look something else french better almost anywhere else  

that said still serviceable french food worthy option bind looking nice restaurant fairly reasonable price vegasmon ami gabi get biggest meh planet  really wanted like place lost virginity woman named gabi

bread fine  good bread really  even italian restaurant iowa give pepper parm add oil youre dipping in

escargots bad  lacking flavor seasoned 17 buck 12 ounce snail meat isnt good deal  good thing ate snail could dip leftover bread snail sauce bread absorbed enough flavor wasnt bad  best snail meat honestly take menu  could better home  ive never even seen snail

scallops okay great  tasted surprisingly fishy scallop  wasnt necessarily bad fishy taste wasnt something used nice restaurant  seemed weird

my gf ordered steak good thought place french  like theyre gonna beat craft dozen place steak

sides pretty meh  rat one plus pommes puree  theyre relatively cheap 6 buck v 11+ place also werent great  guess theyre rated okay given relatively low price

bottom line id go elsewhere  better sort mid tier vega pricewe strolling along strip since nocthing else seemed open decided give place shot one thing loved place right across bellagio water show lovely food good baked cheese die  waitress really nice even offered take picture finished eating maybe backfood ok nothing special really annoyed group waiter extremely rude also one steak arrived coldi agreed come husband insistence claimed must night last year medium rare beef wellington  something really looking forward trying  turned dried piece meat wrapped dehydrated pastry popular place course said perhaps night turned  permanent condition mon ami gabi

we went mom 70th birthday dinner 20 u  disappointed could reserve sit outside get best part place  instead seated inside rather dark loud especially older people  also would seat u half party kind annoying  like seating arrangement much sitting place could get unless everyone row scooted let  

our waitress attentive except gave cupcake wrong person mom sure honest mistake  would say service good 

everyone seemed like food  got scallop decent although side came impressive  believe switch though pretty reasonable price vega would say  think next time would want sit patio  went looked way nicer  would go back try place maybe order salmon  mom said yummyqui présenter de contradiction  two year ago wonderful breakfast today completely different experience  

pros
most food tasty  really truly delish
waiter friendly even though clearly many tables
setting glassed patio lovely
will half order kids

cons
slow service  mean really slow 
over cooked food waffle disintegrated crumb cut english muffin required serrated knife
manager walking floor completely missed plea help

the smoked salmon plate crepe winner  waffle benedict muchive twice recently went group dinner friend birthday weekend vega 

i ordered grilled salmon spinach salad vinaigrette bit acidic inside mouth started hurt  shouldve asked dressing side flavor combination delicious salmon cooked perfectly

for dessert shared banana foster crepe cant remember amazing good im gonna say good memorable since cant remember obvs 

service great price reasonable really good place fancy steak frites casual atmosphere around 25 bad doesnt compare 3 steak egg special elsewhere though different review entirelyi gave mon ami gabi another try recently horrific experience last time year ago waiter didnt take food allergy seriously didnt check kitchen realize staff may come go last experience wasnt fault restaurant gave another chance girlfriend wanted try it

 food probably wont memorable part experience id venture say itll atmosphere sit outside patio youll great view fountain bellagio plenty people watching meantime 

 price pretty reasonable given location 25 steak+fries food reasonable job representing sort fare youd expect french cafe cooked american chef learned prepare food reading menu 

 service latest visit much better waiter manuel according receipt actually checked kitchen allergy back promptly confirmation fact rather unusually make french onion soup chicken stock bizarre allergy know 

  last visit mostly redeemed previous experience ill probably give mon ami gabi another go future reason viewi remember liking restaurant first time went year ago time went busy night reservation went right lot people found service fast good considering amount people fiance steak ok good horribly bad would def order scallop goodbut would really say worth money french onion soup good overall nice view good service overpriced expected strip portion size decent food nothing special dont think going backi forgot pathetic place maybe maybe bad friday nightmaybe terrible suggestion end lesson learned one upsell cheapa cut cow ie skirt steak carnivore throw potato leftover  mean lousy french fry  dish make appealing

i would recomment mon ami gabi fan steak dont mind paying 30 itedited 111712

i 7 time like sit outside  watch bellagio fountain show 

food quality wise cant compare robuchon bouchon  mon ami gabi french version dennys thats sure maybe worse 

ive ground ahi tuna burger bacon cheese burger  nothing special nothing better burger hard rock cafe

ive seafood crepe  ok seafood fresh could using frozen seafood

gratin  greasy  heavy  rich  like gain fat fine worried someone get heart attack 

trout  remembered good 

fish chip  thin sliced fish make pretty greasy kinda one todd english aria fault get fishchips french bistro yo know

newly edited 

i used like mousse pate  along oyster pair wine  great fountain view however went back huge disappointment

jumbo shrimp cocktail  server put dish table something wrong  shrimp looked kinda brown  thought sort spice soon ate realized unfresh oxidized shrimp tasted like dirt horrible im sure use old shrimp dish gross

liver mousse pate  guess one order item  could tell edge dried  pretty disgusting 

endive salad  great experience green leaf turn brown wilt 

mussels  bad didnt break expectation fresh point concerned food poisoning asked get check enough

when food especially seafood get old throw away  know risk spreading food poisoning dont give stained shrimp dude

btw frites better lay potato chip complimentary baguette pretty terrible get better baguette cheaper albertsons

my suggestion  never get seafood know decent seafood taste like get burger  cheap simple guess people giving 5 star eat burger steak seafood 

service  great  busy time  server wasnt nice  didnt stop table refill saw chatting another table tho 

you see men black  indeed look professional funny way  imagine change dennys uniform  surly enough would fit really well

also made reservation today sat nov 10 2012 around lunch time hostess really rude phone  karma yelp haha

this restaurant located right across bellagio grand water show situated prime spot patio area distracting enough lacklustre dish served

i started onion soup au gratin arrived piping hot topped bubbling layer gratineed cheese soup far sweet far gloopy symptom baguette slice submerged dish rather floated top traditional

my entree much better filet pacific snapper panfried light herb batter lent subtle texture fish fish sat top lobster cream butternut squash orzo pasta light flavorful 

there broad selection french wine available plus limited high quality selection beers

i would eat mon ami gabi againthere 15 minute wait outdoor seating say go want spend beautiful sunday morning dim lighting go play slot maybe youll end paying winning 

crab cake egg benedict sensational best crab cake ive little thin side 1595

the prime rib 3 egg also tasty side toast hash brown complimentary jam yum wanted dip finger lick em sorta hehe warning dish prime rib may come done wish want medium say mediumrare 1895

great atmosphere little hectic waiter busboy running around add chair heater minimal space youll find tight spot literally

our waiter also forgot husband kronenbourg required bit reminding

service good beginning water glass filled often baguette coming way  think shift change sudden forgotten wave staff water check  also noticed didnt get kind dipping sauce frites noticed table automatically got ketchup  would happy mayo

overall guess expecting  service food  everyone raf place left feeling underwhelmed  location perfect sit outside fabulous people watching bellagio water fountain show  perhaps ill go explore menui dont get hype place service terrible food great view blocked pedestrian tree price expected better service better food go elli island casino  brewery cafe food good cheap service really greatthe food good 

but 

half way salad entree arrived felt rushed90 love place view inside next open wall could watch water show entire time service great app got steamed artichoke ok bc didnt care sauce served lemon sauce tasted bitter scallop delicious left hungry would go though esp viewmy boyfriend came one morning one breakfast place looked appealing u 
this review going short there much say
firstly entrance inside hotel even though outdoor dining facing strip signage took least five minute find entrance
the option american imagining french entree gets
i know place offer meal day well french restaurant item mostly ranging 1020 bestlooking item served breakfast thats bad sign 
the chicken apple crepe got breakfast average little cheesy good way boyfriend ordered benedict agreed also average 
our server also sort snobbish france best french restaurant town knew nothing french cuisine yuck wont returnoverall ok come nice view bellagio recommend sitting inside glass window rather outside unless want squint eating 

fyi also breakfast end 11 weekdaysfrench onion soup complimentary bread service awesome highly recommend soup

the steak frites disastrous took 40 minute served ordered medium rare came medium well strange cut texture fry overcooked fact like chip oversalted  overall inediblei made reservation late 4th july dinner seated quick restaurant look nice dim lighting get view water fountain strip ordered raw oyster escargot  almond trout seared scallop oyster tasted good small side escargot ok almond trout tasted like something could easily made really nothing special seared scallop ok bit cold side small food ok really worth price service okservice good paying cold food plus

as soon ordered smoked salmon egg benedict within 2 minutes
even server made comment oh must waiting  wowok

everything cold plate  premade  sitting heating lamp didnt work  muffin egg sauce cold  champagne pear  ginger added mimosa section way sweet  add liquor v juice  side dish fruit wasnt even filled up
it 5 blueberry 2 blackberry 3 raspberry  sad display food place many 5 star  could picky expecting food warm

overall 40 worth cold breakfast3rd time charm     

finished conference la nearby needed lunch eaten midday past good results

table 1  greeted dysfunction 40 minute wait  poor attitude bypassed greeter  went sit bar full though surrounded  lot open tables

round 2  seated pressed situation hard
waited waited waited waited waited

ordered skate wing 20 minute later oops apology taken menu yesterday chef didnt like look delivery ordered london broil sandwich day

round 3  cold poorly presented clearly sat light long 
should complain suck  lady next knee deep arguing check service     

conclusion  ate paid left  probably wont returnnot much say food good great ive better french portion decent thought onion soup priced 1095 cup ordinary could probably find better soup diner 
why go get seat outside window seat nice view strip street level also bellagio fountain show youll get great view 
service great attentivei expected place price one tip order steak ordered fillet bland saucy want great steak price go joes say fry great light crunchy like escargot order also liked warm baguette bring outworst steak ever

the steak thin  tried piece filet mignon merlot much thicker nicer  however steak thin particularly enjoy it

as fry disappointing cut like really thin strip give lot  honestly felt like eating kettle cooked chip crumb bottom chip bag  fan especially huge amount lot went waste  prefer thin fry crispy outside potato texture inside  people group really liked fry though

the service alright  nice handing wrong plate come now

the complimentary bread good freshly baked crusty  served butter mixture pickled shredded radish apple parsley

unfortunately recent visit disappointing portion noticeably smaller quality slightly still decent overwhelmingly perfect however mon ami gabi always hold special place tummythe place packed made reservation told running 10 min left fine 

i ordered country pate appetizer dry baguette burnt 

the salmon baby kale salad eh salmon done right amount dressing placed kale overbearingly salty 

the french onion soup delicious 

the creme brûlée okay inside good brûlée burnt hitch took away enjoyment dessert 

nevertheless wont backi chicken pate appetizer 12 jumbo crab cake 18was impressed actually didnt see anything really stood however girlfriend order filet mignon piece butter like spread top delicious meat tender spread topped 

i gave 3 star dish good mine much

for starter give long piece baguette butter thought ok also love bread bread ehhhh

located inside paris hoteli went dinner wednesday night wanted sit outside wait 45 minute hostess gave u pager small range confined one small section paris casino wouldnt work outside ended waiting full 45 minute plus 510 good measure

finally led table directly across bellagio front row seat fountain however also right next wait station server congregating le foot chair entire meal awkward really close quarters

our waitress excellent friendly clearly knew menu backwards forward got half order mussel accidentally put order full size let know mistake said course would charge ordered wanted warn case ordered halfsize future surprised size

so food free baguette butter great got french onion soup okay bad also great little sweet way bread cheese definitely worth 10 wouldnt order mom got steak classique great got mussel mediocre wasnt fan wine sauce almost sour note terrible wouldnt order fry good cut thin salty almost like potato chip didnt dessert table next u creme brulee looked pretty great

i overly impressed food view cannot beat lot peoplewatching strip 7 pm bellagio fountain show every 15 minute food amazing id willing try order different dish escargot roasted chicken looked promisingtypical la vega restaurant beautiful decor high priced food ok average 

they get extra point offering gluten free item menu toast one best gluten free bread id ever unfortunately also served cold ice cold butter alongside yes butter look lovely little ramekin nearly impossible spread 

the ham cheese omelet ok bland hash brown extra crispy like also soaked grease 1495 expected something better alongside cup basic black coffee 4 breakfast nothing memorable 

they interesting item menu might give try next time definitely wont first choicebased oour extensive prior extremely positive experience wife plus three couple made sure visit mag nice dinner final night vega earlier week  could seated immediately inside beautiful november night opted waitheck rolling dice plus free table drink 40 minute problem

when entree finally got excellent bided ample time eating bread appetizer could finish entree  bad entree choice anyone mentioned duck confit seemed 1 ounce meat bone great flavor

the onion soup appetizer horribly cheesy good prior visit  filet steak fantastic bernaise sauce definitely die likely contribute demise 

so taking 30 minute get meal thing go slower wait person next finish using knife dont cut open proceeded wait wait another 30 minute get check  like wanted enjoy nice nightby 1000 temperature dropped 20 degree past hour  

we anxious leave one dared venture desserts

and worst part make back crap table missed 45 minute roll  would paid entire visit wait waitress night

espresso  wow super disappointed imagining sitting paris sipping espresso cafe espresso really bad made perfectly texture color bitter bad roast sort espresso snob coming seattle however dont feel high expectation espresso french cafe much ask expected artisan roast something smooth wrong

now thin pancake excellent happy flavor sheer size literally made think french massive wasteful came pure size pancake however pretty stingy fruit topping possibly 3 strawberry slice flavor good would seemed somehow even better short supply making savor bite however huge portion ate full still sent back half plate food 

overall good experience french bistro french themed hotel might want send manager france paris particular see french really eat live seems like french claim jumper something came portion  jip coffee pastry place think need focus little trying serve great food minimize portion reasonable level stop trying everything everyone imagine accommodating fanny pack crowd challenge make end meet strip however fanny packer ordering thin pancake espresso ihop thing american item make crafted product people real foodie dont totally sell make dollar

as far price little surprised considering 2500 bill 5 tip 30 crepe espresso think espresso 7 actually made even worse taste might go might probably better place fit craving get thembeen four time twice dinner twice lunch ordered steak classique four time dinner great yet lunch failed salmon tartare good first time last couple time theyre consistent therefore im sure would go back service also range great sowelcome disney land  beautiful façade parisian cafe worthy single visit  spell break

big gripe theyve tried cool fry  theyve fucked royally  theyre thin crispy cant actually eat fork total joke  hence two starsmy fiancee went back may vega food incredible downside service water awhile despite fact server assistant walking u water pitcher one looking right u table walked went 15 minute nothing drinkthe staff literally rude right bottom menu read please ask diet requirement cater need dont bother youll likely get eye rolled like server looked like would rather stick pin eye serve u  

for expensive resturant youd think customer service would least prority wrong 

save money lady night grab meal little stop along strip insteadservice friendly pretty quick considering busy 

but impressed food three u ordered mussel corned beef hash 30 steak 

the mussel fine youre going come lunch  recommend three thing tried corned beef hash plain plating awful looked like thrown onto plate steak thin get away recreating dish going local grocery store youd save 2000

its cute restaurant youd expect location youd experience fine dining food isnt greati two time time around fell little flat could due numerous thing patio open heat lampsbut getting little windy end night really enjoy meal might nice covering patio winter decide serve food however view patio bellagio fountain spectacular worth chill

the food felt little underwhelming service felt table seemed like afterthought waitress clearly busy present nice busser wating u excellently kinda wished waiter forgot salad one order bring two dessert birthday boy made it

i filet au poivre rouqefort sauce along root veggie subbed frites main flilet done properly roquefort barely visible sauce roquefort sauce small pat cheese broiled death top filet root veggie really goodthe frites seemed much like potato chip like frites classically servedso luckily able substitute another side really good

the dessert bad good eitherthe white chocolate bread pudding sounded yummy theory sadly sweet bready flavor white chocolate flavor found dish chocolate mousse matter taste suppose small crunchy chocolate ball covered top took dish taste chocolate mousse lacking sweet stress really matter taste mebut cant sugarcoat one

when finally shown table shoved wall took ten minute waiter welcome u restaurant take drink order seemed really pissed didnt order alcoholic beverage went special fast didnt really hear took forever get refill drinks

we ordered brie fairly good husband ordered special veal said food tasted good ordered scallop mine chewy bad way waiter checked u one time passing throughout dinner obviously afterthought

this restaurant doesnt restroom venture onto casino floor order use bathroom 

i would return restaurant food wasnt vega standard price paid treated badly host serverswe came dinner would give 2stars gave u comp cream puff lit candle place celebrate friend birthday really sweet also service rocked 2stars instead 3stars

their food definitely letsservefrench foodtothesetourists sort food although serve fresh warm french baguette start comp bread nicely paired butter pickled carrot yumsizzles

the steak theyre wellknown fillet fillet mean meat isnt succulent rather say super dry also theyre really expensive 25 pop friend got steak bernaise sauce 25

the french onion soup passable make better salty side 9

the scallop butternut squash brussel sprout imbalanced far sweet far bitter supposed complement opinion didnt work

the french fry ninjacut crazy fry like hybrid chip fry theyre thin messy far crispy may like enjoy since expecting french fry paired steak course

all pretty mediocre food price tag id head elsewhere vega mecca good eatswe came dinner valentine day group 6 service decent food ok although amazing area seated dark whole table illuminated single candle overall decent experience except poor lightingi think exception rule see hype service painfully slow understandable given busy wait 25 min order without bread cool 

make sure look bill large party charged service charge gratuity event charge omg 3 extra charge large group

the french onion soup pretty good bread fresh hot steak good fry hard call chipsthis review food salty filet mignon mediocre good part location service id rather dine paris buffet value  maybe brunch would betterthe fry likely expect think french fried onion potato finely cut fried crisp

not bad per se greatthe food incredible reason im giving 3 star review feel though werent treated importance guest two u felt seaters judged u young age assumed wed low paying guest sat tiny corner table horrible section almost theyd rather forget even move candle table make room food may come back simply food die would certainly expect better service considering fine dining establishment still quite disappointed treatedbased merit food experience good based expectation price disappointed  french bistro doesnt pastry available breakfast  crowded loud expensive pretty good  pas  compare bouchon venetianthere comparison  go bouchona french inspired steakhouse right middle la vega strip celebrated birthday meal looking something little different typical vega restaurantbuffet enjoyable meal although memorable

we sat long day traveling adjusting desert heat vega august pretty famished problem sitting staring menu probably good half hour nobody could decide sounded good couldnt even figure wanted drink menu didnt enough variety option meet need sort ofuninspiring

after finally placing order ended bowl french onion soup special day braised short rib served mashed potato spicy sauce soup pretty good served traditional way crock baguette slice overdose delicious cheese little sweet taste serve sort lukewarm think may intentional since 115 degree outsidebut still think would preferred hot short rib good tender portion size right could used spice dish although realize spice level like spice isnt common french cooking

all pretty good choice youre looking dinner around paris hotel atmosphere pleasant especially get one patio table view bellagio fountain food pretty good relatively reasonable type locationthis place nice breakfast portion also good size waiter extremely nice im fan breakfast food boyfriend thought waffle good since food didnt wow give three starthis first time dining 4 year hope way remember fish chip one best thing ive since back vega boyfriend raved much go well visited last night extremely disappointed fish bland chip seemed little hard old im sure changed year change better seated quickly ate inside caesar salad baguette good thus 2 star 1 bill 65 dinner worth many better restaurant spend kind money visiting recommending againcame friend bachelorettebachelor dinner  reservation 6pm table 11 people  trouble getting seated right away

macaroni gratin nothing special best elsewhere strip

it pretty busy went im sure kind attributed le impeccable service hey get people get tired overwhelmed lost one star star location conveniently located strip right across bellagio water fountain time construction going people walking obnoxious drunkspeople recovering night before
but didnt let ruin lunch took bellagio fountain show would come ever 1530 minute ate grilled salmon spinach salad mon ami caesar salad basked warm la vega weather

ultimately pretty good
seeing ordered salad cant exactly give major kudos food combination ingredient salad pretty good spinachlettuce leaf freshthe food atmosphere somewhat made poor service seating given wait long 930 outdoor table however placed far corner hidden umbrella pelted horrible wind smell alley way shady heating lamp reach u hardly approached waitress im huge food critic review mainly address poor service received price paidare kidding me

the croissant sub par

eggs benedict probably one boring egg benedict ive ever seen esp price point two measlylooking poached egg  canadian bacon ham cant remember  english muffin bunch cherry tomato side highlight dish cherry tomatoes
steak frites fry okay steak really gritty sauce saving grace
fresh cherryblueberry juice definitely fresh loaded sugar

i came friend lunch looking forward sitting patio bad wait hour decided sit inside available seat seated next door draft luckily server allowed u move one table 

warm bread provided server came along 

we started escargot de bourgogne 1050 described ovenroasted snail garlicherb butter decent enough butter taste bit much garlic however dipping hard bread sauce still okay unless youre really craving escargot id pas dish

i ordered prime steak sandwich cooked medium wau jus mustard mayo caramelized onion 1395 came signature handcut frites  think ordered mediumrare steak tender would like overall simple sandwich sauce complimented well frites definitely different im use like reviewer said borderline potato chip friend kept calling tease thin fulfill us

i would given place two star server engaging attentive 

sooounless going seated patio bloody mary hand doubt id come back lunchatmosphere ambiancewise great spot center la vega strip people watching feeling true tourist however meal arent extraordinary price  chef friend mentioned turnandburn type restaurant  true foodie would understand notion type restaurant  nonetheless would still come back try entree menunice forget place supposed french restaurant entree come crunchies  fry garlic chip hope people dont walk believing french food like go real paris someday

however steakhouse good conspired friend share steak bordelaise sauce delicious turn got skate shared good great  expecting creamy sauce common french fish preparation pretty dry course garlic chip veggie side bread nice warm creme brulée soso  definitely left torch long couple part shell got bitter burnt taste mouth

oh beginning meal 5 u shared scallop appetizer good good 16 cost us

they alright wine list first place recent history ive get pouillyfuissé glass  great im cheap get whole bottle

not cheap worth going want get good steak dont look french restaurantwe went thanksgiving dinner terrible dining experience  bus boy spilled entire glass wine table got front father shirt  quick get bunch napkin soak mess table eventually changed table cloth request bring u soda water immediately try get red wine shirt  

the manager came didnt good job dealing situation  lamely offered pay father dry cleaning stain didnt come  offer replace glass wine take anything bill inconvenience  dad sit wet shirt remainder meal wasnt compensated way  manager return table promised provide business card could take offer pay dry cleaning  unprofessional

to top eating extremely mediocre turkey dinner waitstaff panicked  running around saying 86 holiday dessert  86 holiday dessert  even thanksgiving dinner anymore  kitchen clearly underplanned run pecan tart pumpkin bread pudding 815 pm  distracting unpleasant staff yelling right near table tried eat meal  somehow waiter managed put two tart bread pudding hold still got even whole debacle kitchen albeit cold didnt hold candle bread pudding gordon ramsey steak

not recommendedvery interesting place dine crave french breakfast  ordered egg benedict special generic dry piece meat  chocolate pancakecrepe strawberry also delicious buy heavy time  

i gave 3 star quality food  however mentioned egg benedict special expected something different unique  came overtly cooked frites tasted like oily potato chip dry meat generic egg benedict  food agree filling probably get type food better quality somewhere elsei excited try place due popularity yelp booked day new year eve running late called say since booked opentable said ok seated promptly upon arrival within 10 minute received email opentable saying noshow  uhh ok someone front doesnt know use computer  

we seated next atrium along right side facing street server brunette middle aged woman bang came take order asked big half serving mussel said 8 piece ive never heard small serving assumed must big said ill take full one said 16 piece came mussel tiny way 16 forgettable ignored u rest evening attentive table 4 next u taking time explain dish brought table great didnt feel discrimination sarcasm

our young busboy however true gem saving grace place came constantly refill water replied yes maam said thank server even stacked dish poor boy told finish clearing table personally cleared table next u leaving even said thank happy new year 

i shouldve gotten name management need promote guy bring customer back know service great potential hardworking hope someone noticesi came three friend early weekend dinner seated quickly great service amazing bread butter steak frites meh hate say overcooked chewyi made reservation wife birthday last week hostess originally spoke spoke broken english hard understand day reservation called push time back little informed couldnt find reservation hostess informed longer table really didnt seem care apologetic asked speak manager manager said shed get u hour later would guaranteed outdoor seating arrived restaurant hostess stand mess none hostess seemed know tried seat u inside informed spoken manager reservation lost promised outdoor seating didnt seem care screwed ended wait another 20 minute table 

once finally got table hostess okay didnt make attempt conversation u informed wife birthday screwed told u happy anniversary sure got food wasnt bad wasnt quite expected great thing restaurant view strip 

overall restaurant worth money staff terrible food okay im fancy five star snob im going pay hundred dollar birthday dinner id expect far better service favor look past placethis restaurant personifies everything hate paris hotel top effort match french themeand sacrifice much quality

i visited establishment steak hunttrying ribeye steak different restaurant throughout u steak decent trying meet french theme sauced thing death 

perhaps better option menumaybe picked wrong thing great steak hunt phase opinion much better place eat strip dont involve theme good food

this first onestar review would honestly consider giving 0stars optiongreat food good price considering vega good location service acceptable par would recommend lunch brunch atrium  strip sidbut probably would dine dinner given nearby optionsexcellent service terrace opposite 
bellagio fountain 
food however le average bistro fare decent wine glassthe steak chewy rough scallop onion soup salty idea get 4 star yelp recommendedfood   ordered onion soup frisee  warm bacon salad beef bordelaise 
onion soup  ok bit salty side generous portion definitely stingy onion beef stock salty rich buttery aroma it

frisee  warm bacon salad  light refreshing simple yet delicious softpoached egg mixed nicely citrus vinaigrette portion small side

beef bordelaise  steak nicely prepared  medium rare asked potato chip side impressive bit salty eat alone 

ambience  definitely ask outdoor seat next time light indoor seating poor suitable taking foodie picture pthis technically review update originally working 2star review restaurant dinner friend bachelorette party terrible food service 

we recently made vega husband really wanted try place family even though tried really convince otherwise due awesome experience month ago pleasantly surprised u mediocre service decentlytasting food  still took long time whole meal service least improved previous experiencebad food beautiful location lesson learned sit patio go elsewhere made mistake coming brunch food par dennys

it 45 minute wait table outside saturday 11am sat inside instead seated near entrance dining room dark table way close together diner stepped u trying sit didnt want hear nascar budweiser conversation

our waiter took order served food checked make sure everything okay completely forgettable oh except corrected wifeys pronunciation crêpe crape pop go sound pretendwereinparis bubble

our main complaint food uniformly bad

the crêpe served floating grainy béchamel sauce tasted like raw flour pretty much ruined it

the croque madame egg overcooked runny yolk cheese congealed toast dry

our brunch came generous serving french fry thin nearly potato chip pretty tasty

the makeyourown bloody mary bar genius delicious there ton fresh pickled veggie different stuffed olive different hot sauce choose would liked larger glass get good stuff 1 shot vodka ice filled half glass hardly room put goody love choose vodka goose pleasei saw wonderful review really wanted come lunch settled  ordered ham  cheese crepe bleh  wasnt good thought seeing friend ordered wished ordered something else instead friend got salmon another ordered seafood platter really good  service pretty bad  took forever get check pretty busy restaurant  wanted sit outdoors least half hour wait time starving came vega opted sit inside instead  may come either brunch dinner picture looked good able try itemsthis cute little place located paris definitely want take advantage sitting patio nice sunny day might little wait though wait around 30 minute totally worth it

the food typically priced around 1025 ordered french onion soup decent size soup nice cheesy crust top definitely generous cheese cheese  happiness like bit lot bread cheese bit oversaturated soup mushy personal preference kind thing really like mushy slimy thing overall soup decent bit pricey french onion soup though 10 10 could better 

my friend got steak au poivre think ordered rare taste tested food seemed medium rare medium thought meat tough side friend complaint moreso loved flavor meat sauce steak huge guess get money worth dish cost 2595 

another friend got big skinny lemon pancake something sort thin pancake bit thicker crepe slathered lemon butter syrup think small bite pretty good friend seemed like fine still ate despite second meal morning 

overall think cute place stop buy nice brunch pretty sunny day friend food okay taste wouldnt go far say unforgettable experience wowwed anything cute sitting patio sun thang thang mon ami gabidont make reservation breakfast patio dont honor  wow even hotel guest platinum member love allordered 3 dish blueberry waffle chicken brie apple crepe egg florentine benedict 
the crepe great waffle cold sent back muffin hash brown egg benedict dish burnt crispy 

service good dont think ill come back though vega lot offercame party 5 sat patio watching fountain belaggio ordered steak chicken scallop scallop mediocre steak looked like pounded wasnt good dinner echo rig night little bit let 

service saving factor getting two star server great attentive without annoyinglocation real selling point center strip get seat outside patio youll get nice view bellagio fountain inside bit dark dingy looking overall food pretty solid went brunch chicken  mushroom crepe pretty good girlfriend egg salad sandwich delicious bread start meal also great however french fry chip served side bit disappointing 

i really excited hear diy bloody mary bar also bit letdown topping nothing extravagant expecting waiter sale pitch maybe standard high come bloody mary wouldnt pay extra particular bar

service friendly slow flag waiter numerous time order ask refill water etc think brunch best time go would go back waittourist trap glutenfree menu  thats got reeled worth it

we started breadonion soup regular gf husband  bad served piping hot

i scallop  served barely warm severely hot dish scallop way oversalted gritty  husband one steak maybe hanger said cooked order tasty

the service felt really forced fauxfrench felt like trying way hard give experience paris without delivering quality  know vegasdining inside found ambience nice although restaurant crowded bustling service prompt efficient professional  choose  steak frites new york  strip cut  steak average size average quality potato  like cross chip fry  good way  wife ordered steak bernaise enjoyed much   overall attractive french bistro  atmosphere good service  decent food   bad choiceok spot someone else paying great business lunch entertaining client food overpriced crave steak frites tuna nicoise salad view fountain spot

btw saw someone order vegetable tagine sounded delicious menu looked like watery disaster came would avoid one stick meat possible definitely limited option vegetarianspopular 
this place view location right opposite ballagio fountain make visual seating dont mind long wait 
we chose place strictly based popularity managed get seat inside crowded friday night order took place crowded inside well ordered fish day steak wish menu gourmet variety food nothing special something would find good regular restaurantmaybe one many amazing meal week maybe one many sangria thought place okay

i thinking high review price getting everything getting great deal higherend nicer sitdown meal best going find vega worst 

we started housemade country pate excellent also got warm brie cheese divine  dont even like brie cheese found eating it

for main course got beranise steak frites cooked correctly find anything special also steak earlier week specialized different type steak could review skewed that

the ambiance place also really nothing special either like restaurant vega table close together feel like dining couple either side reservation 630pm didnt get seated 7pm little offputting well noisy loud couldnt carry conversation table

overall would recommend place someone foodie looking nice sitdown meal affordable price la vega standard someone looking really good meal would send elsewherei would given restaurant 5 star cant dont seem basic restaurant manner dined 0728 800pm

1 reservation 730pm  bf arrived 715 waitress tell u extremely busy even reservation need wait 2030 min past 730 ok btch whats point calling week ahead reservation need wait restaurant shouldnt overbook peak time

when food came dish exactly friend explained steak fry  steak thin strip meat cooked medium  fry thin crispy barely salted  made pleasing side steak  bearnaise sauce thick enough coat either steak fry dipped thin enough start dripping food didnt eat right away  nice buttery consistency flavor hint white wine possibly  

the food good something id travel back paris  really  rating reflection service friend experienced  visited server total four time meal bring u water take order take dish away drop check  asking food refill water even stopping see thing making eye contact server  didnt feel welcomed felt like burden server  didnt feel like french restaurant strip felt like bad night applebees  thats hit applebees im satisfied service applebeesi would give 4 star food go service okay felt ignored way dress  dressed casual since  going vega one day 8 day bus tour yellowstone wanted family enjoyed good food since havent last 6 day made reservation thru open table 3 hour glad could see long wait cant remember exactly order know good  would go back townour server make u rush decide order didnt check table take order rude food ok price quality dish come backcelebrated 2 birthday yay made reservation seated right away 1 hr wait sit outside right strip came eat seen stuffing face loosening belt

steak good pate good exceptional would rave want decent meal good price spot 35 star meambiance nice great selection french wine u dont usually  service good  three star  food somewhat disappointment  ordered steak bearnaise sauce  sauce die price serve steak thin  thin  frites fry cold dried tasting  added nothing meal  also ordered side sauteed mushroom cold way seasoned  id restaurant many year ago remember better quality  well probably skip place next time paris showi give 2 star view fountain mom looking nice place dinner show sat outside great thats great service slow staff rude food 100 bill disappointing disappointing mom steak thin could see right flavor fish chip fish looked like took mallet flat pancake save money pas dont drawn patio dining like weretotally overrated place food mediocre service  slow yes even french restaurant ambience isnt drink food dessert came sync bad overallwe decided wrap trip brunch patio mon ami bit annoyed informed company policy state driver license qualify adequate form id decided get mimosa loss mine brie chicken sandwich good nothing amazing 

weve dinner dining experience food service literally night day many option strip youd think restaurant would game keep customer happy think id pas opportunity came come back mon amiwas impressed come restaurant im pretty easy going first turnoff constant snorting sound maybe clearing phlegm kept hearing thought might patron soon realized employee refill drinksbusboy constant lasted throughout stay im surprised would allow employee walk around like type restaurant waitressshe seemed unfamiliar menu even though one page realized ordering dessert said really thats attitude 

the foodthe bread good thats hard mess ordered classique steak tender stringy trying cut bueno crab cake good frites mac cheese eh pretty decent suppose 

bottom line food service worth price way many great restaurant la vega ever try place againwhere begin first front house one rude individual ive ever come across restaurant industry restaurant extremely crowded look like restaurant would trade table customer comfort

our server seemed overwhelmed steak sub par price fry luke warm salty great would go price dropped 10 plate dont order baked goat cheese unless like lot tomato sauce 

my advice utilize space better get busker front restauranta really solid place establishment gave best shot ordered french offering ordered mouse pate mussel croquet madam escargot french poutin solid flavor profile dish surprisingly cheap given location specialty offering back sure ut sure reservation mustmy girlfriend excited try mon ami gabi dinner part ministaycation  comped night ballys ive meaning try mon ami gabi since moving 25 year ago  unfortunately didnt great experience ive heard many people rave about

first positivesour seat patio overlooking strip awesome view bellagio fountain  even local enjoyed view  server fantastic engaging great knowledge menu  also recommended baked goat cheese appetizer absolutely delicious

we ordered steak frites unfortunately live expectation  girlfriend ordered hanger steak agreed tough  little tough really edible  server manager right thing replaced filet mignon additional charge delicous  got signature steak  sirloin  sirloin thinner edge thicker middle  edge delicious middle chewy tough  im sure steak poorly butchered cooked differently either way wellprepared  time already sent one steak back eaten mine realizing problem send mine back

not sure caught restaurant day  maybe cook called sick got order lower quality meat get mon ami gabi experience  disappointed mon ami gabi live reputation  torn trying many local know love checking one many steakhouse stripdo come breakfast waffle overcooked crunchy quiche okay seer green wouldnt call salad dressing would return breakfast great view bellagio thoughman reallyyyy wanted try breakfastbrunch bad didnt realize brunch weekend breakfast end like 11am oh well fault lazy slow rise lunch good right

oh wrong first look menu seriously thinking going somewhere else nothing sounded amazingly appealing plus didnt want order steak frites cuz broke many minute contemplating going somewhere else bread water came felt obligated stay

the bread divine little know would sustenance almost next hour took 45 minute food arrive ordered speculate happened likely dish finished messed waiting one likely sitting heat lamp quite while

the burger ordered medium rare came medium well came added bacon forgot egg fry limp forgettable entirely

the chicken brie sandwich light refreshing thinly sliced apple adding nice tart flavor crisp texture along tender chicken 

the chicken mushroom crepe minimal kale much mushroom im exactly sure kind mushroom maybe chantelles exceedingly chewy crepe overdone toasty content luke warm 

our server nice enough comp u dessert much better entree overall dining experience seemed reaffirm general sentiment vega restaurant overpriced food entirely mediocre

i sure hope brunch betterwe came sunday brunch first day vega trip  arrived around 11am checking hotel  starving craving nice breakfast  however sad learn unlike restaurant used werent serving usual breakfast menu time  maybe 5 item brunch menu rest lunch menu  specifically asked waiter breakfast item available unaccomodating  especially dissapointing table right next u able order breakfast received food le 10 minute u food boyfriend ordered waffle fresh strawberry whip cream  15 one waffle could came box  whip cream everyone raf meh  must admit im huge fan whip cream general waste calorie something doesnt even taste good  ordered quiche ok rich  definitely taste butter cream put  custard consistency im used though  service waiter basically sucked seemed air  spent time talking corner friend  coffee never refilled took u forever get check  took least another 1015 minute pick run credit card  dont usually ask much waiter usually tip well  rediculous  failed realize every minute inattentiveness decreasing tip  maybe service better outside patio  hungry wait table  immediate seating inside  still huge dissapointment around  definitely worth many place eat stripwe visited restaurant roughly 10 month ago im catching yelp review stay even time found food label hanger steak really shame since really enjoying meal trouble throw free dessert enclosed picture poor waiter didnt know even say showed label something like never go back since make question quality control go kitchen something wish question place eat35 star  3 star really frites gave extra 5 stars

i decided book mon ami gabi open table reading yelp  really wanted patio seating mention month ago christine sent suggestion 2 year anniv dinner  db bil  suggestion french bistrosteakhouses ie clementine sf etc instead celebrating 2 yr sf bf took la vega

service excellent attentive price reasonable steakhouse  sure ill running back soon  ton restaurant try vegasfirst reservation still wait 30 minute sit outside even reservation get place early wait sit outside worth sitting outside alone service ok asked garlic bread baked goat cheese never came isnt really big deal steak got terrible asked chef get medium rare got pretty much seared steak tasted terrible easily worst steak ive ever go somewhere else want steak believe find better one tried save face giving free dessert point wanted get local la vega restaurant telling friend stay away event first time ive ive previously thought excellent going place ever tell friend go herewe heard great review thought upscale restaurant sadly walked seemed like cafe  nonetheless ordered food wasnt anything write home  steak gorgonzola meh  nothing excitinginteresting stop visit really enjoyed atmosphere enjoyed unique need business really enjoyed going brought group group people people business associate really good timewell first walking seeing exorbitant line gave idea place awesome steak house boy wrong

we pretty good breakfast ingredient appearing fresh well cooked bread delicious remind genuine french baguette unique taste texture 

lunch le perfect chose moules marinieres one favorite lunch dish especially served real frites however mon ami gabi fell short broth way creamy mussel decent couldnt get past fact pretty basic dish executed poorly frites also great chip frites thats need order classic item like mm imagine people ordered steak frites bistro style lunch menu would similarly disappointed

unlikely would try dinner bouchon daniel boulud townquite frankly egg florentine disgusting runny egg texture slopped could great crisp english muffin hash fry came super greasy 
the hubby apple crepe chicken  briethis good 
the server friendly courteous please dont give check ask idea finished wanted order anything else
bottomlineeggs florentine worth 1495 food sub pari really wanted like french bistro didnt live great yelp review sometimes yelp let down

we arrived lunch without reservation hostess offered either one hour wait outside seating wait dining inside brainer dine inside satisfy craving fine french cuisine highlight mag authentic french bistro setting feel like dining middle paris

i ordered steak classique maître dhôtel butter sauce found steak really dry tough chew herb butter sauce good couldnt mask thinly dryed piece steak however tried piece filet mignon butter red wine reduction sauce excellent wine reduction amazing filet mignon tender expected

overall view patio unbeatable sitting across bellagio fountain willing wait service steak frites disappointing im willing try brunch menu next time come back vega although im incline try competition bouchonwent tuesday place nice wait wasnt long waitress little slow could attentive ordered croissant egg sandwich okay also blueberry french toast bomb homemade whip cream cappuccino really good dont really serve much overall pretty good cant hold match pantry miragei think place exagerated service fast unfriendly breeads fresh waste money really lackluster experience upon entering met bored employee chatting one finally noticed u guided u table seated able look around check place place brasserie look pretty well marred music relevance decor menu

we ordered frites soup day sea scallop pork chop steelhead special night  however something wrong server quite twitching blinking stuttering bumping back chair etc received frites entree long placed order however soup never showed asked server confused cancelled soup didnt want wait  

food okay nothing special frites scallop salty even though cooked pretty well frites also looked tasted like scrap left bottom pan brown fried crumb  excessive amount salt totally ruined dish steelhead tasty realized 28 buck got check pretty costly compared entree menu average 1924 

definitely worth going back food service view maybe disappointinggo view food  ill give 3 ambience good service  food leaf lot desired   sit outside see bellagio fountain show  probably worst overpriced french onion soup ive ever bf loved steak frites  steak fry  fry awful thinly sliced zero flavor  perhaps dish good cant judge since two  baguette serve good butter applefennel appetizer filled onthis place underwhelming incredibly underwhelming

1 friend ordered corned beef hash shortly ordering waiter return say corned beef hash disappointing acceptably okay given la vega huge restaurant run popular dish especially time like sunday brunch wanted order changed last minute hearing special

try sit patio wonderful view strip fountain bellagioobviously restaurant great location dine across bellagio fountain gawk gander people walk life pas strip cant help feel little snobbish eating elevated patio munching croissant start speaking french accent point nose air let big snort okay maybe not

on weekday around 9 nice table patio available u spring time vega definitely great time outdoor dining heat humidity summer roll around id sweatin like mad man water misty machine world wouldnt prevent melting

right bat service pretty bad putting menu away sat good amount time wife flagged somebody noticed people sat u already getting served could see vein popping forehead happened uh oh good sign

finally waitress came around got around ordering food went egg benedict went breakfast sandwich wife seemed enjoy food enjoyed breakfast dont usually egg benedict often definitely reminded heavy dish good everything seemed bit bland 

overall pleasant dining experience nice view course price high side im glad tried place breakfast perhaps well give dinner shot sometime many choice vega might tough returnsat bar 10 minute bartender never even looked direction acknowledge methis place suck ordered seafood platter 49 2 half lobster 4 tiny oyster salmon salad 3 shrimp caramelized sea scallop 25 scallop worst ever 4 scallop pretty big definitely grilled could taste bitterness wont recommend placewe came good review ordered seafood platter got small dried oyster half lobster cut another half  waiter tho fat rude mid 30 mid 40 beardmustache got move table eat somewhere else  guy never ask want refill drink course thirsty hell got want wanted much tip  would recommend place anyone go back everhuge disappointment friend came big party birthday dinner restaurant dark classy looking cool atmosphere def looking unfortunately known service going freakin slow food going taste like whole salt shaker dropped im pretty sure wouldve opted another restaurant 

i shared pasta french onion soup friend didnt think pasta salty friend kept insisting french onion soup came tasted salt boy salty couldnt really eat alone since salty tried eating bread restaurant served even still much basically ended stuffing bread butter night oh water course 

after halfeaten food taken u think table waited good 30min1hr waiting check yes understand take awhile split big group check shouldnt take waiter long even come table start annoying process splitting making sure got place waiting table long put u grumpy mood 

i really hope service isnt slow smaller table even service faster prob wouldnt come back since dont need much salt one mealamazing view bellagio fountain show seat outside service ok foodtho horrible tasting steak pretty awesome time ate ended hospitalyeah intense forced go third time refused eat anything friend eat awesome steak ended hospitalwhats wrong w foodi server indicated famous steak salad supposed kale actually spinach top poorly seasoned tough chicken breast exorbitant price also zucchini gazpacho good cost far value warranted suppose pay ambiance sitting outdoors beside strip qualifies doubt ever return would recommend anyonewe great time nice restaurant didnt mind party child seated corner fine service good bread start great 
everyone party enjoyed food child unimpressed kid burger odd bun cut circle shape 

i wasnt impressed steak fry ordered medium served well done salty hard option worth 30 40 tax tip  family seemed enjoy would returnwe went fiancé birthday asked host bring cake bad attitude  body brought anything food okay average food average price offense decorum restaurant totally give vibe good classy time food doesnt measure 

ordered roasted chicken fritas chicken came dry roasted herb chicken every italian american restaurant serf version thisso manage disappointment screw bland sort juicesauce component go chicken 

do get trout eat lot seafood able tell instantly fish par trout came thin dressed lemon caper caper incredibly overpowering thereby masking fresh seafood taste dish might 

the beef bourguignon also another version beef stew tickle fancy 

bread came paper bag enough said 

service moderate time impossible flag waiteressgood food  french tell dont expect food actual paris city  nice bistrot  good simple lunch one great reason eat thats perfect view bellagio fountain sit outside patio enjoy every 15 minute evening  ok decor look great food underwhelming price 

we got fresh baguette served strange cole slaw seasoned butter middle road

i hangar steak frites ordered medium delivered medium rare sans steak knife disappointed fry nothing like ive france belgium like crispy potato noodle tasty expecting cognac sauce tad bitter

my husband ordered mustard salmon said good great served bed potato puree said rather bland entree include vegetable 

overall spent 70+ soso meal great view thats vega nutshellour group somehow hit place worst  order lapped neighbouring table came ordered ate paid left food showed french toasted arrived raw batter one side blueberry still frozennot sure fuss absolutely great location however food eh service hit miss happy hour cocktail nice house rose champagne beer selection short side appetizer plate sparse actually served u dried bread cheese plate le enthusiastic warm olive nice served deep bowl generous really added nice touch like said great location thats huge fanits difficult pick place eat vega multitude option guess packed house like one sure see mon ami good sign

i found bread stellar cute display served baguette style one would find france although france dont paper bag baguette im sayin beef bourguignon bet even julia chile would proud version although might disappointed noodle waaaaaaay soft

im pretty disappointed cocktail french restaurant mess french 75 

the ambiance nice heater music bellagio fountain show feel bit crowded patio though little space move 

all would like money back try equally expensive restaurant higher quality food experience know vega find let knowthis used favorite lost lovin feeling slow service rude waiter view still good worth wait cramped table inch may table next staff appears care anymore place list many great restaurant townjust one tender fillet ever never order cut beef bordelaise sauce weak light runny garlic spinach bland  rating low food atmosphere friendly service rock
returned dinner night  french onion soup fantastic prepared classically   sweet broth gooey gruyere  chicken entree pretty bland  portion cooked nicely still moist seasoning  come put herb de provence least asup bird  served boat style dish made hard eat mashed pot side veg okwhat ordered lunch feeling like eating brunch food ordered seafood crepe consisted crepe large grilled shrimp scallop cream sauce crepe contained pea cream filling dish topped fresh raw spinach 

what thought crepe light tasted great pea cream sauce shrimp seasoned well tasted good little overcooked scallop favorite part cooked perfectly seasoned well nice crust 

overall thought dish good seemed lack oomph really dish 35 star yelp would let restaurant situated cool spot overlooking strip across bellagio fountainswent dinner  service excellent

starters overpriced escargot  tasty worth cost sea bass overcooked possibly gone bad  sent back one bite didnt bother replacing different dish  rib eye steak frites decent steak disappointing thin unevenly cooked frites  

loud dark atmosphere 830pm seemed bit mismatched vibe menu trying set  would still try breakfast based review wouldnt go back dinner even discountgreat location upscale bistro environment served great french bread corn relish upon arrival stuffed pork chop caramelized onion tasty albeit small portion 3 slice salad disappointing unremarkable dressing lack presentation service great waiter attentive informative cost ratio basic french nothing mouth tingling wanted steak would probably go elsewherethe wine subpar straight bad tagine glorified tomato soup tartare mediocre left desert whole place extremely overpriced way better alternative strip 

this place deserve current 4+ ratingmon ami gabi far french steackhouse like advertise descent expensive american diner sat offered ice cold water french baguette butter delicious didnt bread plate wanted green tea didnt water guest 14 mimosa better sip slowly 
we shared escargot dish friend quiche loraine tagine though huge wasnt great 
when guest got coffee delivered without spoon ask 
the waitress either careless coincidence wasnt thrilled service paid 77 lunch bill realized restaurant isnt part paris hotel property dont get point cant even use reward card 
i highly suggest eat inside get ac still enjoy nice view bellagio 
overall thought staff bunch young inexperienced girl couldnt care le customer maybe drunk truly appreciate restauranti came steak frites mood steak frites got steak frites sure outdoor dining look everyone walking strip didnt matter since hunt steak frites

but endit ok
i steak frites really good one including paris version relais httpwwwyelpcombizrelaisdelentrecc3b4teparis3hrid1il8osb1dx8fjln2jegobasrcself

although place steak fritesit wasnt better relais version good nothing worth getting excited youre vega want steak frites place probably youre best bet 

i like banana foster crepe dessert dessert like profiterole au chocolat creme brulee besides steak frites also serve brunch too

i managed get table made reservation advance otherwise would probably wait awhile noticed lot people loitering hotel lobby area make reservation herewe went mass review yelp let say reason place getting one star bad service got server efrain made u feel comfortable hello grumpy want kind attitude used waiter even bad day would leave door ordered ahi tuna burger prime steak sandwich pretty much thing cheer scallop felt like couple day old seafood crepe apetizing seafood tasted smelly old chicken bri sandwich look like pilled bunch worst place overated dont go unless want eat mostly shy food crappy service stay awayi unimpressed food service unimpressed indifferent cant think anything else say didnt like itthis 5th visit mon ami gabi menu changed slightly longer baked brie fun new stuff like pulled pork bahn mi french tasty 

steak frites always safe option come variety sauce choose favorite still au poirve peppercorn brandy sauce baguette serve tasty try hard fill owe hot fresh baguette

the country pate also quite yummy mild flavor dont mind come area piece toasty bread whole grain mustard sprig fresh watercress well variety pickled item yummy starter share little much eat starter

hospitality great accommodating change order without question 

i order chicken grandmere came salty dry dry drank 2 glass water gave eating maybe eighth waiter generous switch order chicken paillard came fast however chicken dry flavor didnt taste right 

after left went mcd get 10 piece nugget mealcocktails tasteless people front desk ridiculous rude waitress plus attentive patient wish got namecalled ahead refused give wait estimate phone im visiting state guess common practice west dont understand know wait time estimate change quickly frustrating wont share info phone

ended walking way another restaurant shared wait info saw many empty table outdoorslets say 1 star sum small group weekend brunch disappointing waited hour food even though werent busy server never around probably cause knew gratuity included importantly food underwhelming fyi chef need learn using salt starter good thing say gluten free bread wont ever back thoughwe took parent vega mon ami gabi mom 70th birthday based review looking forward good steak dinner ordered standard steak probably cheap tough steak pounded thin make tender still lot tough piece left plate mom ordered cooked medium came well done dry rest u ordered medium rare got medium well least edible mom thing nice brought little cream puff dessert mom since birthday stated reservation reservation got seat window nice waitress attentive almost ignored u compared waiter place ordered appetizer red wine cocktail cheap dinner overall disappointing since live review service mediocre best would recommend restaurant would go back go u nightfood still great service bit slow plus nerve get rid bloody mary bar mad bit sad

i ordered filet mignon regular menu filet ok also quite salty although still eatable however make wonder paying price grill better filet home side plate around filet simply huge portion fried shredded curly potato taste full grease plate around filet curly looking like pubic hair absolutely appetizing

probably going back worth time moneyview location great especially convenient staying hotel wasnt easiest process make reservation girl hostess stand werent friendliest got downstairs reservation time still wait 15 minute little awkward bar full people waiting group 7 waiting cramped dining area additional seating hostess stand waiting better receivingwaiting area 

once seated took waiter come u request bread took drink come waiter general personable missing time restaurant good timing view course amazing bellagio fountain even though cold sit outside still great view inside 

food wasnt memorable like review food came lukewarm table group 7 ordered steak meal 6 7 disappointed side ok memorable would definitely stay hotel wouldnt revisit restaurant although enjoyed restaurant sitei excited try place walking restaurant smell food wafting restaurant smelled divine craving fish atmosphere quite cozy chic quite busy service wasnt terrible good couldve 

i ordered escargot de bourgogne skate wing escargot really long time try quite disappointment garlic herb sauce escargot extremely buttery point could feel butter wiping mouth definitely appealing escargot bit chewy side skate wing arrived aroma intoxicating texture light similar tilapia type fish flavor wasnt overwhelming fan caper bit tart side little putting dish came fish chip made inhouse extremely delish probably would buy whole bag could

for fish place fantastic great atmosphere would definitely want go back try dish im huge fan french cuisinethey got u seated lunch immediately beverage order taken instantly however appetizer oyster rest meal took time filet mignon served french fry steak tender lacked flavor thus reason giving 3 star ratingreally liked restaurant breakfast fantastic deal especially vega got ton food omelette entree hash brown thick toast egg kept u full pretty much dinner coffee 400 unlimited refillsi like coffee super hot wasnt appreciated kept refilling 

i would absolutely try againcame reservation brunch

fruit boquet expecting something rather large since waiter said itd bigger fruit plate came half cantaloupe diced like flower pretty couple chunk pineapple stuffed felt kinda ripped since expecting bigger variety fruit really hard cut cantaloupe flower well overload cantaloupe definitely dont get thishuge rip yogurt side creamy mint syrup light refreshing though

gluten free toast tasted like real toast jam delicious homemade actually enjoyed toast mucheven slightly toasted

mushroom omelette full flavor much simplistic boyfriend said couldve made home half price even eggs

egg white omelette pure egg white nothing else veggie extra ingredientsmy friend disappointed 

overall mon ami gabis food executed well visually appealing really lacking little twist oh make food exciting word although delicious restaurant bit safe term food option itd nice see add interesting flavor twist flair item ex putting ingredient egg white omelette

ps friend got french toast loved apparently stick sweet item come heremade reservation via yelpopentable mag came away fairly happy start dinner 4pm convenient pretheater crowd pretty fairly priced considering level service atmosphere 

the baked cheese appetizer best thing tasted night would order barring lactoseintolerant dining mate le enthralled sea scallop accompanying mushroom velouté asparagus good scallop ok  mostly texture sear however sigos steak béarnaise excellent come back id probably try one steak instead

so really 35 maybe ill round depending outcome second tripgreat place get breakfastbrunch service hit miss depending server otherwise food point highly recommend wggs benedict complaint use come hash brown side instead cone cherry tomato order side hash brown 56 supportive changedo frites every entree frites pretty standard cheap vega standard food decent view bellagio fountain show sorely disappointed expect place decent french bistroeating vega often feel like eating restaurant disneyland atmosphere phony food cranked like assembly line handle traffic  mon ami gabi like

we ordered steak settled since assumed would take 15 minute prepared cooked properly  arrived 6 minute later  thin piece meat thin impossible know mine mediumrare welldone  seems conveyer belt steak cook throw onto plate pour sauce top  20  25 minutes

yes affordable strip wasnt blown away mean  upstairs one private room nice view casino floor

i glad suggest restaurant since everyone group let downi used like going  nothing way special one decent place lunch youre staying near parisballys  group weekend  made rez understand policy seating group everyone fine pretty snotty 2 people 8 present would within minute budging seating majority group starving flying day

we placed order rather fast food delivered quite timely  except one order wrong server waiter guy brought food said hed right back correct order  20 min later replaced meal server sight waiter never bothered check u  finally flagged seemed sorry quickly got missing meal  

i understand mistake happen restaurant  also understand importance taking care customer  said sorry really checked soon meal arrived avoid drama since didnt job looking table comped extremely late meal didnt  better institution would apologetic charged meal would manager come check u  none done 

besides fact ive visiting place year also feel quality food gone significantly  onion soup fair nothing great frisse salad pretty sad much dressing enough lettuce egg undercooked white  item liked past

needless say going back next time im vegaslet say first may absolute best beef bourguignon ever service pretty good side delivered wrong peep management adequate view fountain better standing across street front bellagio really place see without palm tree way 

my issue hard core screwing took u dinner 13 wanted 100 non refundable deposit charged larger party 18 gratuity still ok long service successfully stood challenge part came kickeranother 4 plus tax 4 werea wedding dinner called banquet charge call bullshit two table next 6 7 respectively would business usual table barely 12 inch apart  anyway 

one insult required sign contract stating would pay whatever charged put credit card number retainer two table kind nonsense would burden verbal happy something would adjust contract reflect verbal assurance went every grain business instinct voted go elsewhere outvoted better half nuptial party 

long story short usually tip 20 would service food received nickel dime bullshit extra charge whatever name want call thatbullshit

we probably give second chance view great food right pretty good comped breakfast mixup nicehad high hope perhaps problem 

 nice atmosphere
 awful wines

 great steak merlot reduction 
 skate wing sting ray decent
 trout salted
 mussel decentthe wait bad compared restaurant friday night  show get 10 pm waiter great getting order time

french onion soup ooey gooey cheesey good fresh bread give you
pate fresh worth price appetizer
seafood platter fresh seafood deceiving  worth price quality great isnt ton foodmaybe lobster roll ordered  tiny piece indistinguishable lobster could shrimp  virtually dressing lemon juice flavor  overpowered celery chunk  place disappointed  tried steak frites steak past two day hoping delicious change   lobster roll place bay area far better would one star review  plus one awesome table glass enclosed patio could keep cool enjoy outdoors vega july shocked positive review experience pretty mediocre husband toddler grabbed early dinner last night lot review say place kid friendly guess doesnt translate toddler friendly known asked could get u high chair one hostess laughed u bad

i steak frites bearnaise ordered medium came well done steak super fatty gristly sauce pretty bland fry werent bad though

my husband steak frites classique style steak cooked medium requested also pretty bland seasoned least edible though fatty like mine was

the good server attentive friendly husband celiac disease small gluten free menu brought gf bread made sure keep separate regular bread bread entree came little allergy toothpick seemed knowledgeable eating gf also didnt get sick cross contamination 

the verdict overpriced get need gf option think worth checking otherwise id skip iti eaten halfdozen time new year eve order see firework patio

the view patio awesome across bellagio dancing fountain quintessential la vega view boulevard either direction patio mon ami gabi truly epicenter la vegas

the decor parisian french bistro one would find holodeck starship enterprise almost perfect certainly nice

the service also good real complaints

so two star food suck know dont care

but view patio night compelling worth mediocre food really gee place could much restaurant get 2 star onetime reasonably priced dinner tourist patio view worth price admissionwe ate breakfast mon ami gabi enjoyed experience part

french toast
 toast seemed bit burnt didnt seem spent much time soaking egg wash
+ blueberry topping whipped cream made dish

quiche lorraine
+ light flaky tasted fresh
 somewhat smaller hoping given price

ambiance
 crowded busy popular place
 outdoor seating mean youre subject weather day case meant 102 degree noon
+ two guitarist playing street nearby actually skilled added experience much tipped afterward cant really credit mon ami gabi this

service 
+ prompt attentive service
+ short wait around 1030 weekday morning
 table wasnt cleared previous guest dish prior attempting seat us

overall moderately good dining experience enjoyed food staff great youre paying strip price premium dining wish french toast turned bit betterbrunch redeemed experience place  

french toast really good say  crispy around outside soft soggy inside  whipped cream delicious blueberry fresh  favorite dish usually never is

chicken liver pate deliciously creamy  like place there always 31 pate bread ratio youll gotta eat straight save tableside bread 

french onion soup tasted last time good

when went saw croque monsier menu  asked could make croque madame poached egg salad side instead chip fry came right  huge portion would consider sharing youll get tired eating it

overall food good hiccup group  example 1 food took abnormally long 2 friend order got switched wasnt informed food came 3 ran corned beef hashthis unique place craziest atmosphere ive ever located across street bellagio great fountain view 

as came place reservation line half mile long short wait bar got seated start disappointing bordeaux really good bread next country pâté chicken liver mousse pâté chicken liver pâté best ever 

now rub trying enjoy really good french mealthen seems trailer park bomb exploded horde spandex clothed mutant rushing throughout place kicking chair stumbling place really appalling try enjoy good food see many rude people really cant buy class unpleasant site people must mirror suffered rest meal adding french onion soup  grilled trout delicious 

this resturant obviously volume without mutant crowd management plan shame could great placeone word describe restaurant sketchy went seeking place brunch looking review really excited seated immediately 2 u brunch benedict dry corn beef hash greasy bloody mary ok received check completely surprised total asked waiter receipt 10 minute came back said threw cant find explained total equal meal overcharged u spent 300 night dinner frugal mean confirmed correct still swiped credit card incorrect amount ask manager said here 20 dollar dont tip shocked left immediately make sure check ur billwe handed menu ordering waiter informed friend item ordered would take hour cook went lunch item dinner item shouldnt separate menu least indicate menu item dinner item 

waitress got face close face personal comfort 

food good much butter salt  couldnt even finish asparagus swimming butter oil way make vegetable unhealthy lol 

on plus side salmon tasty moist gluten free bread satisfying crispy 

all okay food plenty room improvement preparation serviceoverall food fine ambiance nice  however wouldnt consider great dining experience would likely never return given many option vegas

we ordered brie honey  roasted garlic appetizer ceasar salad salmon salad merlot filet mignon portion large everything potential amazing everything ended ok great

people often compare bouchon although ive bouchon yountville  wholeheartedly say  doesnt compare youre choosing two  id recommend bouchoni usually steer clear strip come dinner around town main reason everything overpriced location

this place exception extreme location limited amount outdoor dining strip im willing shell little experience dining la vega blvd 
unfortunately didnt get experience tucked away tiny table right next door 
no big deal except seemed little hidden server well
the table tiny felt like table coffee shop
again would fine stopping small bite cafe starving came serious dinner

we ordered seafood platter 4995 entree meant split 2 people addition ordered largest steak steak frites menu 22 0z bone ribeye 3995

the frites crispy real surprise steak bit disappointing high quality cut flavor steak wasnt reason came time seafood platter specifically asked brought appetizer steak later finally finished seafood platter steak continued cooking another 10 minute plate little past medium gotten cold
we little disappointed time couldnt flag server let know issues

the seafood platter exactly fresh filling although im aficianado french food maybe im redneck who eaten red lobster one many timesbut cant help feel like need drawn butter lobster shrimp
oh well cest la vie

baked goat cheese
pate
steak bearnaise
steak tartare 

the baked goat cheese lacked significant flavor love cheese pretty much melt cheese world let dip bread would happy cheese meh 

the pate also particularly tasty mom love pate girlfriend never knew would love tasted one surprised didnt rich flavor pate usually 

the steak sauce bearnaise realllllly good loved steak pretty good didnt justify price smothered sauce really yummy though 

we really excited french fry like chip good great werent fresh quickly went cold soggy asked fresh batch one dish arrived cold fry fresh one excellent sogged real quickly cold waitress said area greenhouse area wind tunnel still disappointing 

the steak tartare also ok spice pretty good nothing wowed excited take another bite 

overall atmosphere beautiful food pretty decent however price expected didnt help service slow different server taking order helping u confusing even multiple people felt service really slow  

i wouldnt spend money based experience based review think ill give another shot girlfriend pointit okay heater lamp outside broken seated u outside asked move inside lamp working restaurant packed didnt move inside moved u another outside table tell u didnt gas lamp couldnt really enjoy cold

the food good little pricey thougheveryone know like place went waiter rush eat leave probably give another shot see initial assessment correctpros restaurant literally feel like france old dripping paint wall service excellent checked u every refilled drink every often 

cons amount pay food decent got seafood crepe basically 3 prawn 2 scallop crepe decent barely touched meal friend got quiche steak said decent well call

overall bad place try youre least 80   lucky u vega provides u opportunity gamble huh win money halfkiddingpretty good food restaurant disappointed service

i ordered corned beef  hash thought quite delicious  lot place know corned beef thats dried like crazy however place pretty solid tasted goooooood especially nice long weekend vega golf gambling girl  okay let face much girl part  oh yeah friend ordered stuff frites fancy name fry surprising tasty  like mcdonalds tasty shape flat thin made enjoyable

service little poor  expect vega right  friend missed 2foot putt win sunday event pulled chair little closer sitting patio got stabbed protruding nail  stuff happens blood shed  gm quick provide bandaids ointment etc server thought good idea hammer nail back one else get hurtbut friend still sitting chair  mean weird situation weird fix  wouldnt remove chair get new chair

loved patio facing strip cold air circulating around despite scorching day

ill probably come bc patio great wearing glove 

dmo outfood good nice patio good view however  heavy rain came got move inside  food got cold waiter disappearmeh impressed

the restaurant atmosphere lovely really enjoyed eating breakfast atrium looking strip
i excited parisian meal received typical vega hotel meal
the egg benedict ok nothing write home coffee awful mean awful
if one reason return europe coffee one area mon ami really try perfect
the waitress seemed little snobby although attentive
i would say ambiance service good food price charge ok 
actually one best egg benedict ive vega new york new york italian restaurant adjacent lobby

maybe expectation set little high mon ami based location review thats fell little short
at rate give solid 3 star bring authentic french coffee ill think increasing 4 steak good service attentive  atmosphere intimate elbow elbow thanksgiving night  checkin process needlessly complicated two host stand  one front casino side real host stand inside  reservation still wait slammed thanksgiving patron  steak undercookedi would probably give restaurant higher rating werent service

we came breakfast saturday morning came early enough wasnt long wait seated rather promptly croque madame honestly fantastic wanted great flavor came homemade potato chip like potato straw delicious companion got breakfast sandwich thought alright much mayo breakfast sandwich enjoy side breakfast potatoes

the problem service hardly saw waitress dont know overstretched table constantly drink wait 10 minute find get another oj finished meal sat 15 minute empty plate front u could get table cleared find check felt overlooked waited table mostly larger groups

anyway maybe bad day got server day choice vega sure backi 3 time normally think good nothing ridiculously amazing  atmosphere cant beat watching bellagio fountain eating wedding party grabbing bite

ive eaten mon ami gabi twice lunch dinner  would probably choose another restaurant next strip visit   many fabulous restaurant nearby much better value moneythe food ok people seemed loof professional even remember ate wait nothing special crowded inif youve never spent halloween vega cant possibly imagine missing  truly unforgettable experience  costume alone worth trip  never mind racy costume see street anytown usa  vega slutty nurse slutty cheerleader  theme slutty  seems though whole town trying get away wearing little clothes possible still considered halloween costume

the patio mon ami gabi perfect place people watching halloween  normally would gushing spectacular view bellagio fountain gushing get day people watching  since moment sat patio darn near impossible concentrate menu

the dinner menu mon ami gabi basic one  french food simplified middle america  doubt go steak frites  thats motto  restaurant offer wide variety steak frites plus limited selection fish poultry vegetarian dish  even burger menu one mood le big mac royale cheese

i opted steak bearnaise frites bowl sweet potato soup  soup came right away presentation impeccable  single piece meringue looked lonely soup plate waiter brought old kettle real spout poured pureed sweet potato around meringue  kind like ile flottante sweet potato instead custard  presentation soup lacked kind unique flavor  could used spice ginger  cardamom  allspice  added pepper wasnt enough  also mention soup wasnt even hot  come guy kettle

for french restaurant mon ami gabi sure give large portion  steak frites came big plate thin piece steak literally covered crunchy thin frites  steak pounded tenderizer thin tortilla  marinated wine speculating grilled served u  difficult say whether quality meat truly extraordinary steak sure tender  course took old shoe sole assaulted meat tenderizer marinated overnight would nice soft well  frites greasy begged eaten two hand fork required  kind like tiny speck lay potato chips

we stayed patio another 20 minute finished dinner  evening halloween party vega beginningthis place average idea lot good review location nice thats recommendgood location service make sure review bill leave tip table  party five lunch gave waiter 18  tip cash  review bill found charge u 18 tip bill credit card  experience 6 8 people automatically charge 18 tip didnt know charge even 5 peoplethe restaurant nice service great  baked cheese appetizer really good rich got crab cake appetizer entree could even eat fishy gross boyfriend got salmon tasted okay nothing special  maybe ordered wrong stuff really wasnt impressed regardless reservation make wait front desk slave stated first come first serve  absolutely reason terrible service ive coming year last visit last time ive decline dont risk take business elsewhereoriginally chicago let begin saying im huge fan lettuce entertain restaurant fact already great experience joes el segundo sol trip vega however stunningly poor performance chicken pate like brick skate returned due overwhelmingly strong ammonia smell filet friend ordered medrare blood rare got table finally wife duck tough although taste ok believe hit terrible night 530pm though didnt get charged skate searching manager bad might return give another try food roulette mon ami gabi vega known gambling  highlight kind server maria seemed embarrased entire experiencethe filet beef wellington totally tasteless texture suggests poor cut meatpoor breakfast experience returned 2 4 item disappointed dinner always good may different chefshad lunch friend flight definitely tourist attractiontrap whatever wanna call 

the food spectacular reviewer said youre paying view bellagio fountain also people watch patio hey concept huh like street cafe  see france

one glass mimosa 10 glass tiny

the prime steak sandwich wasnt bad get end piece burnt 

the fry actually good thinly sliced reminds fresh potato chip would come back fry 

over priced mediocre food best hey try once35 star picked mon ami gabi late group lunch long day work trip review proximity staying upon entering restaurant liked choose inside outside day restaurant seems livelier outside super quietdark inside picked spot inside next window least get sunlight people watch still dont worry loud tourist crowd outside coming dinnerat night probably wouldnt matter sit inside outside

i thought lunch menu good lunch selection however seems like typical easy frenchamerican selectionlike salad burger crepe sandwich etc looking something super fancy never probably place looking place casual yet nice ambiance relax work wa good place us

we provided complementary french baguette go butter appreciated whole serving baguette came baguette paper envelope also nice touch restaurant failed bit though wait time food 3 u ordered easy dish like salad sandwich crepe ordered croque monsier around 34pm want even crowded much didnt get food probably 40 min afterby time tired waiting dont get wrong waitress nice kept refilling drinkshowever wait much especially restaurant wasnt crowded food ok finish dish one colleague finished another lady didnt finish platei think everyone ok food one really said anything wowed taste

fairly diverse menu french based steakhouse  bistro really great boudreaux wine exceptionally priced overkill markup  8 tow dinner ill break simple possible hot french breach loaf exceptional homemade butter presented  waitress took forever get u even longer take order spending god know long chasing wine down

appetizers  
french onion soup good nothing world 950 bowl soup piping hot lukewarm little cheese covered bow  big miss simple french item 
baked goat cheese 895  tomato sauce warm garlic bread better escargot warm garlic butter hit two friend   mussel white wine herb also huge success 

entrees

the escargot good  ordered dover sole dinner special 3595 super bland good amount fish like 4 piece one bone kinda gross happens served barely cooked spinach potato thank god came 12 lemon bc flavor dish salted peppered well  unimpressive meal didnt even clean plate

for main dish chose seared salmon lemon butter sauce orzo  bland tasteless sent bitch as dish back  description menu made sound good  looking forward orzo sucked real life  sorry pity huge casino expecting something dissapointing im dining one  bf liked dish though  maybe chose wrong thing doubt ill giving another chance redeem themselves

steak classique steak frites maitre dhotel butter steak reasonably priced size larger expected part tender butter green im assuming blended parsley green give color butter surprisingly flavorless add salt pepper give flavor fry thinly sliced potato retained way much oil definitely didnt take additional oil fry dish good price opinion flavor thing killed though 35

average food nice ambiance vega there many place good food opinion likely wont come back herewe came breakfast  expecting blown away food based review wasnt case  although sitting area beautiful overlooking bellagio passersby husband impressed selection  got chicken brie apple crepe said flavorless  crepe nearly empty  hecalao asked fry side ended getting potato stickschips dont order fry youre expecting regular fry got three egg breakfast egg overcooked hashbrowns  nothing rave  one thing turned immediately reason 2 star rather 3 star rating distinct eggydirty smell surrounding u even received meal  would pas place next trip lvthis place okay  restaurant crowded loud  dont go looking quiet romantic evening  cocktail ok la vega level  place go want eat health either  everything meat cheese covered oili hour left wanted great last meal vega flight home really excited try food many good review ive seen truly  disappointed ambiance nice seated almost immediately close patio good view strip however waiter seemed like good mood also felt like trying rush u 
we started oyster corn chowder soup wild escargot chowder good escargot bland ordered pulled pork brisket bánh mì pork didnt much flavor served soft bread typical baguette im used boyfriend ordered maine lobster roll decent overall food service definitely worth price perhaps want viewmon ami gabi popular french brasserie though found brunch mediocre disappointing restaurant great atmosphere nice service though

mon ami gabi la vega paris around long time still seems popular ever  la vega likely walked past french brasserie one big outdoor patio outside paris hotel look like either great spot hot place brunch lunch  mon ami gabi famous chicago chef jean joho also run paris fine dining restaurant eiffel tower restaurant chicago everest

while fan eiffel tower restaurant looking forward trying mon ami gabi  french brasserie seemed like good choice delicious expensive brunch  really liked look  outdoor patio nice part year restaurant also indooroutdoor dining area offer good view lot sunlight still provides french bistroesque room good table comfortable temperature

mon ami gabis brunch menu feature mix breakfast lunch dish egg benedict omelet steak frites sandwich like croque madame ordered  unfortunately good  ham thickly cut quite dry toasted bread dry hard way crunchy  cheese stretchy melted quality good croque madame has

the croque madame topped course fried egg  unfortunately fried egg quite burnt around edge  fry thin potato chiplike cut  super crispy liked soft inside contrasted crispy edge  unfortunately fry quite salty

for dessert profiterole much better representation classic french dish  vanilla ice cream creamy smooth profiterole chou pastry fresh enough  chocolate topping traditional thin dark chocolate sauce  instead thick double fudge sauce prefer traditional thin bittersweet chocolate sauce chocolate combined ice cream pastry make satisfying dessert

service good  server pleasant polite attentive  food came good pace

prices bad breakfast brunch option  steak dish seemed pricey similar la vega restaurant though la vega restaurant tend overpriced

bouchon la vega signature french brasserie try seek place  bouchon perfectly fine feel similar bouchons yountville beverly hill term food yountville location easily best bunch  mon ami gabi offer unique experience people west coast mon ami gabi several location middle country east coast

unfortunately food mon ami gabi simply good  liked mon ami gabis service atmosphere bouchon much better option desire french brunch dinner would probably cost much either  comme ca cosmopolitan would probably also better option french bistro fare mon ami gabi

like la vega hotel casino paris offer complimentary valet self parkingbest  french bread creme brûlée patio seating

worst entree didnt taste quite right  ordered steak medium rare one gray purple center  took indication steak old  everything else good could bad day steak

overall give place another shot bc really enjoyed ambiancei went high expectation reading review recommendation hotel really dissapointed overall  going view fountain show across street bellagio definetly go great  5 people 4 5 meal done plain boring  expect tourist food tourist location  wont back  would prefer stand across street fountain watch show go restaurant decent food  take pas find something elsethis used go one favorite la vega restaurant unfortunately recent dining experience conclude quality gone downhill ordered steak medium rare came extremely well done bring replacement around 15 minute later fry cold dry party member dinner restaurant fairness take steak bill overall experience ruined point wont dining mon ami gabi againwe decided check restaurant got good review b offer meager gluten free selection food wasnt bad per sey could imagine better omelet dennys bfs gluten free egg benedict also seemingly subpar flavor department 

even taking account taste discrepancy regular gluten free item didnt feel like breakfast lived hype 

i could however imagine dinner fare bit better  green bean came omelet best part meal 

service excellent  friendly efficienteveryone hostess waiter friendly chatty  smoked salmon egg benedict  egg runny salmon salty way like

since french bistro figured couldnt go wrong french item  son wanted try escargot ordered escargot de bougogne  time france montreal canada disappointment  1195 piece small could barely taste see picture dish untouched barely see   son thought eating mushroom  classic quiche lorraine also total let  salty bacon seen tasted couple strip onion  make quiche much better  hubby warm chicken brie sandwich said good fry soggy  

perhaps place better known steak dont know  meal would return place  there many place eat vega thats much betterhorrible customer service bring large group salesperson helped advance nothing cause frustration management doesnt care want give business advice dont arrange group dinner meeting company know ill never bring meeting vegas

since gorged bachannal buffet caesar earlier super hungry started apps oyster scallop fresh done perfectly decided warm goat cheese salad flavourful lighter id highly recommend goat cheese finish really love good chocolate mousse selected larger portion light chocolatey delicious

one word caution restroom restaurant need exit restaurant follow left side sport book casino 

overall everyone group great meal awesome conversation restaurant cheap norm vegasi disappointed dinner  thought 4 star 344 review  place must solid  pizza fast food place venetian satisfying

maybe im harsh semipositives meal
1 french onion soup server claimed best ever  good cannot agree claim
2 french fry  thin crispy cooked like  think im committing faux pa saying thought fry better famous bouchon fry tried next day
3 bread pudding  server claimed best ever  good best ever  love bread pudding stuff okay  ive def lot better nordstrom cafe bread pudding best
4 oyster  didnt try bf said good love oysters

however positive didnt really balance great entrees

my bf ordered roasted chicken flavorless  dont offer roasted chicken house special going dry good  

i ordered fish frites hence yummy french fry  fish disgusting  pounded fried like one large circle  took 2 bite couldnt eat anymore  yuck

i might given another star sat patio 45 minute wait overall wasnt bad would check bouchon bigger brunch menu next timemy wife restaurant twice become mustgo place u love food love view music fountain would recommend anyone visiting vega amazing decided take family wedding celebration flew china wedding never vegas

we large group 9 people dont know english menu entirely english take bit time understand expect top family member vegetarian naturally took bit longer translate order everything server extremely impatient rude giving attitude asking many question told look menu dad uncle ordered signature steak came either mashed potato fry didnt even bother ask u want fry  uncle dental issue obviously prefers mashed potato give choice switch either understand multiple table serve wasnt necessary treat family way felt scared ask anything wedding celebration night uncomfortable since party greater 5 mandatory 18 tip otherwise would left anything them

i love food restaurant disappointed way international guest treated traveling someone doesnt speak english please look waymy friend gabi aka mon ami gabi definitely french inspired atmosphere dim low key lighting made relaxed romantic setting situated across street bellagio hotel pretty easy spot came friend nice dinner 

we decided order french onion soup appetizer first mozzarella cheese top delicious however didnt particularly like soup sweet large amount sautéed onion flavor good though 

we ordered steak filet mignon hanger steak steak au poivre cooked specified temperature agreed steak needed salt steak au poivre french mean pepper steak kind bland didnt detect hint aroma black pepper kind disappointed considering paying good amount money quality steak side frites ok 

overall food wasnt bad wasnt world good however happen walking past restaurant la vega strip still give go havent tried everything menu item may goodmy husband brought mon ami gabi last night vega honeymoon really loved atmosphere seated right away since husband made prior reservation sat facing patio decent view strip night waitress didnt take long come take order drink explaining night special such

i ordered paris romance cocktail husband ordered special sangria start evening hubby also wanted try warm olive jar personally wasnt thrilled tried anyways

while waited drink come noticed waiter waitress kept leaning behind grabbing something turn sitting right front keep jar iced water kept bumping leaning every time grabbed jar honestly thats made night annoying

so drink get hear waitress say parisian peach drink im sitting wondering ordered 100 hadnt ordered peach drink dont really like peach turn got order wrong brought cocktail listed right paris romance return drink get correct one

next olive jar came strange jar filled variety herb garlic olive jar pit rather unsatisfying sit nibble around seed order eat olive itself

during time got warm loaf bread butter scarfing pleasurably however waitress inattentive u keep getting attention waiter lovely lady wasnt checking u 20 minute meal finally took order ordered steak classique added lobster tail husband ordered 3 artisan cheese side order garlic spinach hell thinking

we waited good long im going guess another 15 minute food arrived time missing waitress still wasnt keeping u ask another gentleman bring u bread take empty olive jar hubby food arrived couldnt help laugh giggle girly little plate food

three piece random cheese wheat cracker slice apple spinach looked like pile mutilated grass mulch ordered read review yelp another guy ordering friend laugh think enough hubby order ala learn somehow

anywaysmy steak huge ended cutting half giving big slab husband felt bad ordered also shared lobster tail admit lobster steak good great necessarily best kind french cuisine would hoped

all ok experience probably wouldnt go back service wasnt great neither food atmosphere though honestly give 4 star ambiance food service still get 2 12 mewent husband group 7 total coworkers last night business trip exhibiting magic fashion convention 

the experience started moderately rude waiter sure playing stereotypical rude french part pleasant way start evening minus 1 star seated nice table outside definitely highlight restaurant bonus watch bellagio water show table

 fresh bread butter shredded carrot delicious best part meal appetizer ordered meh salmon sashimi like ceviche escargot entree variation steak dish came luke warm luke warm fry minus 2 stars

overall lackluster experience definitely want relivewe sunday brunch mon ami gabi 9417 food decent waitress ginger haired lady pennsylvania pleasant gave u good service hostess rude unhelpful could find reservation gave u buzzer could wander paris casino table ready approached 10 minute let know thought buzzer may malfunctioning listen dismissed u telling u wait called went back 10 minute ask status table  meant 10 minute wait asked hadnt come buzzed u  food fine special well find another brunch spot next time townthe last time went got seafood tower shrimp rubbery fishy run restroom afterwards  used favorite place sad last visit terrible ambiance beautiful great view food lacking escargot pretty good definitely favorite renditionthis review based entirely poor service received even get chance eat difficult seat u grew tired waiting incompetence finally left

unfortunately busy seated outside sat inside food good 3 four u chose salmon benedict good great came rosemary thyme cherry tomato pretty tasty also tried side hashbrowns wonderfully crispy wayyyy salted 

overall good breakfast three star nothing really amazed food ok decore nice place clean go along nice french theme 

i guess desire eat mon ami gabi go dinner seems known fori went lunch dinner lunch better dinner  dinner steak came cold send back next time warmer hot  good thing view belliago fountain show wine glasspretty meh  food definitely quality would expect price  went work friend dinner conference wish wed gone elsewhere steak liked duck night special bad call pretty bad  service good nice room food goodi came group friend always heard good thing place  server friendly really attentive plus

other everyones food average salad grilled chicken added  chicken tasted like tuna  enough saidi homework yelp upcoming trip vega super excited try mon ami gabi yelp user commented great food awesome service im hoping experience anomaly either case dont think ill visiting restaurant again

heres happened
 made reservation 11am saturday brunch reservation dining room although outside patio seating looked awesome didnt want wait hour line
 came time 11am told would sec get seated however didnt get seated 1110am willing overlook know brunch must crazy
 restaurant dim inside understand part ambiance restaurant particular didnt work maybe seated think id actually prefer wait hour patio seating
 finally seated server came said would bring water bread  came minute later take drink order remind water bread  

the food
 brunch menu underwhelming surprisingly ordered chicken mushroom crepe lunch menu
 food brought wasnt hot chicken mushroom crepe pretty good nothing blew water disappointed wasnt warm all

 really wanted try bread french baguette everyone yelp mentioned reminded server bread halfway meal said would bring out
 server never came point pretty much done meal whats point getting bread youre done main course also pretty surprised none party around u served bread either point wondering ran bread couldnt server tell u shouldnt ask something twice especially server told would bring bread soon got seated

there bunch people walking around suit  im assuming manager idea supposed  clearly werent watching tables
the couple sat next u waiting 10 minute check left table left empty another 10 minute someone came clean considering busy restaurant assumed someone would come clean right away ive much busier restaurant much better efficiency

by end meal pretty annoyed happened server miraculously remembered never got bread pointed someone cleaning jokingly said guy fault  supposed bring bread blame guy fault still  job ensure bread brought out

rant

again hope experience anomaly experience left bad taste mouth ill probably never return againi high hope place awesome review im usually pretty easy please especially vega live expectation although avoided wait got table right away hostess unfriendly cold u burden 2nd hostess much nicer server started strong soup came great tanked whole thing guess kitchen backed ordered raw salmon ordered salad nothing needed cooking took 40 min come server come check u didnt fill water severely overpriced service quality food received neither u enjoyed salad salmon though soup fantastic honestly may bad day would returnfood average remotely good price would seem indicate service appallingly slow time went unless want pay sit hour wait appetizer recommend going elsewhere strip

had banana foster waffle breakfast one day good ahi tuna burger lunch another ahi bland flavorless sandwich ever had

although waffle good worth extreme wait friend sat 45 minute ordering food finally brought u time went lunch waited hour ordering finally getting food

i definitely going back point staff make mention apologize u long waitmake reservation sit outside near front restaurant clear view bellagio water fountain show order quiche lorraine blackberry currant ice tea pear salad yummy tooim biased nickname gabi  however french skill tell mon ami masculine thus implying gabi dude  digress

im biased place good brunch  doesnt vega glitz  glamour get solid egg benedict  opted egg florentine egg benedict spinach artichoke hollandaise sauce 1595 flavorful perfect runny egg  left wanting   dont know potato  fruit  something  plate egg benedict roasted tomatoes

if sit outside perfect peoplewatching andlets face itvegas best entertaining place people watchi visited restaurant two separate trip vega first lunch fine price teeny bit high bad food good 

the second large bachelorette party dinner  didnt turn nicely 

pros 
they got u seated one long table
the service attentive
the cocktail ordered fabulous gabitini
the dessert die for

cons 
we seated 20 minute late even though made reservation month advance
we drink casino wouldnt let u bring inside
the price unbelievably high got  25 mediocre chicken steak 1215 dinner salad okay wine control bill 15 peep 885
also frites nummy fry rock hard tiny crunchy teethbreaking
the aforementioned chicken made sick later well

so look  think place might fine stick certain dish  maybe drink  dessert may night far food go dinner price ridic definitely wont visiting friend gabi next lv tripwe came brunch one occasion dinner recently  ordered steak asked medium came well done  gfs scallop burnt  sure wrong kitchen day food good  best part meal outside view bellagio fountain free bread butter  100+ well spent  left dissatisfiedi bit disappointed waited 20 minute patio seating 2 ended indoor seating got inpatient hungry would give u option standing line long check point oh well waited another 10 minute top seated isle way right indoor outdoor sat booth part bf sat chair right walkway server soon next table sat squished place put purse backpack comfortable lighting horrible one minute would super bright sun outside next super dark cloud cover dim indoor lighting service lacked 3 server earshot tried pas table among really youre like 3 ft away youre work food wasnt great although apps yummy smoked salmon pate entree covered sauce bland half meal felt little sick knew gotten soup oh well ill skip place next timethis place fancy staff friendly inside seems little cramped party 3 sat fine everyone else around u looked smushed food pretty good wine nice overpriced bottle soup amazing entire dont remember got posted photo alright sauce wasnt honest place overpriced know french establishment vega thats expected bottle wine soup entree split amongst 3 girl ended paying 80 think could gotten better tasting food le soup good though id come carrot thing come bread kind odd got annoying waiter kept hovering around u waiter table next u loud wouldnt shut make sure get good seat outside inside everyone bother youno way 90 mediocre meal one beer   cant put french spin make worth price  go somewhere elsegood brunch go day nice weatheri heard raf restaurant brought 3 guest dinner  food ok 22 oz  rib eye steak 50 fat bone undercooked scallop ok frites vegies barely warm  waitress good compensated bit foodits obvious draw restaurant location sits directly across bellagio fountain bodes well didnt wonder restaurant would still business vega stiff  restaurant competition 

mon ami gabi loud fairly small restaurant wouldnt recommend plan ton conversations

we came celebratory dinner steak frittes food wasnt bad wasnt great okayand stiff competition vega thats enough particularly price steak properly cooked decent sauce 

bottom line id recommend want stellar view fountain dont mind paying quite bit okay foodwas good great could memorable

our table seated next another table way close course larger louder group 2 u wanted nice quiet dinner throughout whole meal couldnt hear making meal quite annoying sit hear table loud laughing true lol moment 

we ate quickly left
staff great food really special vega standard
coming back unlikely next vega food journeymy experience mon ami gabi okay think number one thing disappointing dish lukewarm french onion soup tasted great wasnt hot gruyere cheese didnt ooze like usually also tried croque madame egg benedict french toast think food average decent nothing gave wow spark bread super dry crunchy hard chew consistency 

although food could better opinion view amazing course bellagio water show go without saying great place sit watch hot summer day vega think would rather try brunch spot area maybe place would better suited dinnerwent lunch food mediocre atmosphere amazing sat outside reminded exactly local cafe town paris exception table space lighting ambience truly made nostalgic wish food better burger friend crepe fairso im going start saying food good got one star due server blatant disregard table came 5817 lunch two kid overly nice somewhere would think would unwelcome sat promptly server didnt show least ten minute two table around u sat different server show mind im sitting 7 2 year old dont expect special treatment expect server brain realize kid table maybe put kid food first keep drink coming server ignored u finally took order every table around u sat u got food stopped manager apologized nothing correct situation server continued ignore u husband served college always make give benefit doubt particular day overly busy literally avoided u every time came way im glad ordered sandwich didnt give anymore money good food horrid service apparently manager good staff ignoring people nobody ever checked u backservice good food quality disappointing  corn beef corned beef hash salty pain au chocolate soo embarrassing french restaurantsoggy greasy bc heated butter seeping pale looking brown color  bad croissant  u get better crepe crepe place  would probably stick egg bacon next time orange juice best item  great people foodie dont know french food  ambiance outside patio nice though  probably returnterrible service disappointed heard great thing made reservation 745 still wait 35 min hostess extremely rude name christina talking purposely looking responding good start dinner impressed customer servicelocated paris hotel casino  dropped late dinner  french bistro enter strip left  inside casino called mon ami steakhouse  big clue

as late wanted eat light  ordered sea scallop  big mistake  came right away could smell fishy  mean fresh  hubby ordered wild boar little rag pasta   traded didnt want risk getting ill  point like 1030pm  didnt want wait another entree 

our friend ordered hangar steak  winner  hubby got wild boar  yuck chunk wild boar doughy pasta stuck together   shouldnt boar meat shredded

they also got cesar salad french onion soup   enjoyed both

i got house merlot  good  served hot baguette paper bag  like french bakery excellent bread

bottomline  enjoyed glass wine bread 

our server girard funny toothis place super hyped thought going super french bread french place got 

came brunch cousin shared salmon egg benedict nutella waffle salmon egg benedict good nothing special nutella waffle wish oozing nutella minimal 

i think love jam idk wasboysenberry good though bread addicting service nothing special felt like waiting forever bc remind server even bring bread usevery time come la vega make mental note dine view second visit vega girlfriend decide dinner huge lunch included probably stick butter whole loaf bread ten strip bacon im complaining didnt want eat anything heavy couldnt fit clubbing outfit dancing night away food baby didnt get steak frites everyone raving instead lemonthyme seared salmon orzo pea leek spinach lemon butter salmon little bit dry everything else really good wasnt heavy left feeling like 3 month pregnant light filling fact paid 25 dollar piece fish size 3 year old nephew foot overshadowed view view beautiful nice able look see eiffel tower towering head also caught bellagios water show 4 time whole time sitting love love able watch tourist walking strip 

until find rich heart surgeon husband take paris private jet  mon ami gabi satisfy curiosity parisian experience close ever came paris visit paris paris texas way bank account lookinggot steak classique didnt seem like anything special quality steak average felt like could make home maitre dhotel butter top pretty good think deciding usual choice steak filet lunch time seemed proper get dish shouldve safe went filet fry interesting amazing got kind oily near end

the item remember would probably french onion soup 
onion soup au gratin baked gruyere cheese full cheesy deliciousness one best french onion soup ive awhile

i also tried friend steak au poivre brandy peppercorn steak bordelaise caramelized onion  red wine sauce ultimately sauce satisfying didnt enjoy steak itself

also two guy wearing tank wear huge white apparently tall much better

overall bad maybe give another shot jumping conclusion come definitely try french onion soup made lasting impressionits one place limited menu  dont like  im picky need variety  lost star  

thursday night reservation wait sit inside  1 hour wait sit patio  service friendly  ended ordering french onion soup scallop chicken grandmere  french onion soup good  place make salty french restaurant better get right  scallop average  good wasnt anything special  chicken good  one best chicken ive restaurant  little bit pricey casual restaurant strip  didnt think food special  dozen restaurant back home orange county good better priceit wasnt much anticipated expensive little food mediocre service wasnt creative tasty normal restaurant overpriced good location stripseated 815 reservation 905  local rarely venture strip wanting show visiting relative good time went  unfortunately wasnt worth headache  next time friend family town well stick summerlin bouchon run like well oiled machineripoff alert automatic 18 gratuity party 5  includes breakfast

other place fine cannot stand sort cheat anymorecame great review  ordered fresh oyster french onion soup good steak however filet mignon beef wellington wasnt good steak chewy sauce wellington sour  sauce also made pastry really soggy  service ok sure id backthe food good service pretty checked uninterested job 

1 waitress pushed alcohol member group  even though person clearly expressed desire something nonalcoholic waitress asked two time whether would prefer beer wine get hint sometimes people dont drink dont want pressured drinking seriously rude especially considering people might recovering addiction might medication 

2 dessert served waitress dropped little spoon front u height maybe three inch felt kind like threw silverware looking away  message could care le 

3 member dinner party accidentally dropped butter knife five staff standing nearby heard clang knife stone floor looked went back chatting wait station  good restaurant someone would quickly bring new knife person dropped flag someone specifically ask knife 

4 waitress picked credit slip wed signed checked tip standing table good wait staff leave credit slip table touch diner departed

there couple good people team get good service one individual particular wish could remember name overall experience greatthis fourth time eaten disappointed went mother day 7pm appears running low veggie wife scallop excellent lacking menu description asparagus nil tried make using corn sea bass lacking flavor strip view nice food disappointsexcellent customer service  patio area make spot great restaurant experience 

otherwise ate average tasting  average presentation also egg white  turkey omeletteso decided give place try since like sunday brunch vega say hype best food seating tight party 7 adult 8th month old son yet still charged 18 gratuity even though son ate puff drank bottle pretty ridiculous never going backcame weekday night dinner wasnt busy pretty chilly chose sit inside windowside could still get good view bellagio fountain sadly view street performer outside know creepy statue men come life

now let explain

we made reservation friend birthday dinner  make reservation especially fine dining restaurant like mon ami certain expectation come along  first foremost expect seated reasonable amount time  sat 900 830 reservation  second expect whole process relatively hasslefreeyou give name seat table reserved  instead handed pager told u wait  pager went told u could seat u outside even though requested indoor seating reservation shortly indoors 5 minute  restaurant would lot understanding hardworking host staff  place like part price meal go towards service offered establishment  felt get value night dined   

all venting ranting aside ambiance food waiter service excellent  would recommend warm brie cheese sea scallop hors doeuvres  bonein ribeye excellent strongly consider special  group tried roasted orange duck sea bass good  

in closing chance go random night perfectly pleasant dining experience dont shocked find frustrated waiting reservationi breakfast first morning vega 

honestly breakfast nothing write home ordered plain bagel others boyfriend two friend got pretty elaborate dish boyfriend got corned beef came side hash brown egg toast salty didnt like tasted little weird

if youre looking cheap place definitely place 5 dollar bagel plain bagel almost cried pay 2 extra dollar tip rating reflect price however  honestly like boyfriend dish muchand everyone agreed food alrightamazing view bellagio overpriced mediocre food 

we visited late afternoon around 4 pm hostess quickly seated u outside view incredible enjoyed bellagios water show watched people walk waited food

the food disappointing although food moderately priced compared restaurant strip wasnt impressed taste ordered jumbo crabcake hanger steak chicken grandmere
 crabcake pretty good bit salty
 hanger steak alright bit tough bite cooked medium requested medium rare fry amazing though probably favorite part meal crispy delicious
 chicken disappointing wasnt much flavor stood however baconmushroom side delicious came close second behind fries

overall think would rather pay extra visit expensive restaurant higher quality foodafter reading review decided come birthday lunch time husband think experience disappointing first food ok got steak frites since better somewhere else think food ok wouldnt call good great anyway besides service great think unluckily got one didnt well meanwhile saw another server sincere customer wish server restaurant need know service server could affect customer dinning experience great extent dining experience negatively affected server totally wasnt happy birthday meal way husband noted birthday reservation dont understand didnt make pleasant someone birthday
we gonna go back even someone want treat u waste time unpleasant restaurantthe reason even giving two star simply view lucky enough sit patio enjoy beautiful view bellagio fountain otherwise ambience isnt best restaurant crowded table close together dark 

the food average friend got macaroni cheese fancy macaroni used kind cheese friend care left weird aftertaste mouth also presentation mac le appealing blob mac bowl would expect 20 macaroni 

i sea scallop come 4 small menu say come asparagus checked server said oh mixed vegetable scallop came corn pea mix kidding youre serving frozen pea corn frozen small scallop fine dining restaurant charging 30 ok 

i also dinner salad came hair server barely apologized brought new dinner salad second one half size first looked like mess bowl quickly get dinner salad 995 literally lettuce 4 slice tomato took 4 bite eat whole thing

in term food id recommend escargot french onion soup duck confit  id suggest skipping pate  overall food ok definitely bit overboard sodium content  dish great first bite quickly became rich  salty

why 3  4 5 well wait staff little slow forgetful asking twice one thing one waiter one day one thing asking two different waiter twice two different thing twice syndrome would go back yup ill put slow service food location fun atmospherewe reservation via opentable valentine day  arrived saw huge line people waiting get restaurant  told hostess reservation said people  since hungry went elsewhere  review food fact would overbooked  much competition area easily found another place  dont take reservation wont honor themmaybe expectation high beef bourgogne salmon escargot onion soup okay probably better average vega strip food nothing escargot pretty disappointing bouncy texture looking

service nice efficient seated patio overlooking strip pedestrian ordered dish sharethe salmon tartare steak au pouvre also got carafe frangria since cant resist anything rosemary 

the warm bread salmon tartare homemade potato chip probably highlight meal although pickled thing look like miniature watermelon long stem lot seed nasty thing restaurant serve little devil mixed delicious cornichons gross

the frangria sadly left bit desired although sickeningly sweet like sangria also didnt depth flavor description led believe would couldnt taste fruit definitely could taste rosemarywhich made sad 

the steak also okay cut thin even though ordered medium rare part steak pink 1cm slice toward middle like steak juicy flavorful place despite hype steak fell short cut

the restaurant full inside arrived greeted three friendly hostess front desk  patio seating area completely packed 9am business excellent  waitress greeted u friendly smile took coffee order proceeded explain special day  ended ordering mushroom omlete crepelike stake cinnamon pancake huge ordered special egg benedict served roast beef caramelized onions

overall wasnt impressed food reasons
the hollandaise sauce egg benedict already starting break served  roast beef way overcooked little tucked poached egg  side breakfast potato aka hash brown reminded dennys

the mushroom omelet okay nothing fancy probably get similar quality omelet ihop view ambiance better here

the crepelike pancake  nice thin fluffy flavor excellent  worth since food delicious unique

service  excellent  friendly  coffee cup frequently refilled condiment asked make meal better delivered timely manner

price includes vega strip premium

suggestions breakfast stick fruit nonsavory breakfast item appears better  come dinner lunch since offering appears look bettermaybe ordered didnt really enjoy anything place 
first want outdoor seating get hour wait hour go encouraged u wander come back get back staff let u know wait le time expected wait bit longer 
once get seated outside ordered pate soup salad french martini beaujolais red ok price paid expecting something little memorable meh 
i would rather save money go elsewhere honestyi wanted like restaurant really honestly wasnt fault  
having sat patio direct sun cooked u cool temp 85 degree watched butter slowly melt glass chardonnay boil steak fry turn grossly greasy  
make dinner plan sun go enjoy romantic view bellagio fountain chat fashion sense people walking  p  dont forget order french onion soupif dining experience consists diverse selectthan golden corral youll sorely disappointed  restaurant going view bellagio empty interior packed patio suggests  shrimp cocktail wasnt properly deveined nothing like little crunch dirt seafood  service okay real knowledge food   find hype quality food experience view fantastic hoping couple sens tantalized  viva la vegasive reviewed ive right time  wont go back stop recommending place  many reason  

they charge 18 gratuity party 5  six service horrible  saw u twice order give u check  refill checking nothing   going tip 10 amazement mandatory 18  called manager  came told issue remove 18 instead apologizing put blame back u said asked  bottom line  blamed manager blame put back u show issue staff management said would walk reluctantly removed 18 dropped check back table apology  

the steak overcooked u mean time  disappointment ton option highly recommend party 5  careful  

the place dark  hard read menu chair wicker uncomfortable mostly make table turn quicker   obviously money rather service  go elsewhere

i got impression mad sat party 6 8 table  didnt want wine already drank thought felt werent big value table  figured got 18 automatically enough  wasnt crowded  amazed never checked u   restaurant make 18 mandatory 5 show service issue   usually 6 8attended business dinner group 12 although line door restaurant filled near capacity seated immediately upon arriving one side room left hostess station server met u warm smile went night special apparently staff really stretched simple menu distributed water glass filled server politely informed u shed return shortly get drink order 

after 10 minute promised returned took drink order although wanting order selection appetizer table share dashed enter drink order seated least 20 minute drink arrived began taking appetizer order avoiding mentioning anything else referencing placing dinner order although possession menu least 30 minute first round drink mostly expired understood informal business dinner time wasnt really concern except rather spending time crap table feeding one arm bandit appetizer arrived second round refreshment ordered clearing table seafood food selection distribution recently order round cocktail dismay inpatient soul seemed unimpressed evening  felt evening slipping away finally placed entree order 

i say oyster exceptional fresh cleanly shucked shell still full natural liquor sized nicely delicious well plentiful 

after hour half entree began arriving somewhat surprised inexpensive dinner selection wasnt surprised quality fact little disappointed find popular venue didnt upscale selection known orientation upon arriving remembered stated sirloin pointed signature dish huh along signature fry chose pas chose filet asparagus kale salad adorned soft poached egg honestly salad amazing generous portion shredded kale fresh cooked bacon warm bacon dressing filet ordered medium rare came well done asparagus cold tough 

although venue nice good service amount customer crammed food okay considering dinner went two half hour time two cocktail served several u chose exit dessert explained gracious host offered option since getting rather late evening exceptional dinner choice available strip would consider restaurant breakfast lunch even afternoon drink oyster appetizer dinnermy husband lunch last week  underwhelmed menu ended ordering steak sandwich burger  food nothing special ambiance restaurant nice  feel like waiting patio table sure lovely  seated quickly rook next patio plenty natural light  

it mean memorable meal certainly worst meal weve ever  im sure would return future trip mostly many place try vegaswe went friday 21513  unfortunately highlight evening bar  short wait table ready drink  bartender friendly

once seated opted start escargot wife went onion soup  pleased selection good awe inspiring

for main course selected steak roquefort wife opted beef short rib  short rib good steak mediocre best  stringy tough  mentioned server told type steak  wasnt expecting dry aged prime beef 25 wasnt expecting par applebees either  

however real reason two star rating dessert  abstained wife choose banana foster  server smiled went way important point later  shortly thereafter plate delivered table somewhat resembled  banana foster somewhat  wife remained positive stating guess flambe  first bite gave disgusted look said cold cold including sauce  tried sauce shocked  cold thin caramel sauce  liqueur rum wasnt even room temperature cold  ugh

i stopped manager told dessert  responded prepare dish couldnt warm since contained ice cream  really even dairy queen pull hot fudge sundae  said weve dish several time never cold often prepared flambe  went say illegal tableside flambe la vega  asked remembered mgm ballys fire said fire caused tableside flambe since la vega restaurant  

wtf  flat lie  fire caused electrical problem exacerbated construction allowed fire travel rapidly ceiling even noticed  wife seen tableside flambe la vega restaurant lie

needless say didnt waste time arguing dishonest person  told take dessert back remove tab check delivered could settle leave 

when brought bill server apologized werent happy dessert said happens people used prepared differently   didnt advise u ordered dish  disappointingfood high quality particularly imaginative atmosphere mediocre unless patio seat offer great view bellagio fountain would recommend mon ami gabi first time tourist would uber cool seasoned tourist local better option spectacular meali dinner saturday night family member  waited 45 minute table terrace overlooking la vega blvd  atmosphere totally worth wait people watching nice nightnot cold hot  reminds lot south beach miami

we started escargo tender fresh herb butter sauce wasnt good  need butterythis french restaurant  duck confit much betterperfectly cooked greasy duck

i steak au poivre  steak really tender wished peppercorn sauce kick  bland taste bud  accompanying fry good flavorful truffle fire envy steakhouse renaissance hotel  enjoyed nice bottle cabernet meal  full dessert

so would come atmospheremon ami gabi sits right strip either sit outside people watch inside stay cool highly recommend people watching section specifically came saturday brunch get corned beef hash really high hope didnt anything huge chunk dry chewy corned beef barely mixed potato poached egg perfect hash brown crisp way like would still recommend place sits right across bellagio fountain get great show

wwwanitaeatcomi thought place fine high point ok 3 star  wild escargot good garlic parsley sauce quite tasty though nothing like puff pastry version bouchon  fresh baguette butter ok nearly good bardot  lamb good rustic flavor cooked medium well asked medium chimichurri sauce tasty ratatouille bland boring  mashed potato ok pomme purée stated  service good atmosphere fair   wont backgood french food average service

stopped mon ami gabi vacation vega  wife thought superb 11 year ago happy see still business  recalled much loved french onion soup

with relative coming street disappointed young lady managing hostess desk  wouldnt even say long wait unless full party  could understand seated rude tone nonsensical retort cant even give estimate wait time got thing poor start  seated immediately family member arrived

the menu simple enough food good great  salad unremarkable  fillet mignon good  final bill 205 four adult toddler baby  note put 18 gratuity themselves

there much better year ago  better service would readily give three starscome yelpers dinner tonight continues maddening recent trend flavorless illprepared food restaurant received great review yelp  palate please stop reviewing restaurant pseudo french restaurant served dry roast duck passed confit scallop sliced half likewise devoid flavor side served purpose confirm kitchen poor conception flavorhaving mon ami gabi bookmarked awhile finally got chance come company vacation last december didnt reservation wanted sit outdoor patio served first come basis told wait would roughly hour surprised seated 20 minutes

if youre planning sit outdoors prepared tight cramped seating patio popular choice like restaurant wanted maximize space squeeze many table possible view bellagio fountain slightly make worth one extra star view

i started st germaine cocktail 15 light sweet refreshing onion soup gratin 11 baked gruyere cheese heavy flavorful couldnt finish since salty egg benedict 15 consisted canadian bacon standard unmemorable rest party grilled salmon  spinach salad 20 maine lobster roll 18 seemed fairly mediocre well

the service left lot desired server friendly outgoing couldnt found half time maybe busy seemed wait forever everything even small requests

not sure id come back unless im mood bougie al fresco lunch bellagio fountain music playing background every 15minutes want decent food price youre better grand lux café want better food view arent budget go one bellagios lakefront restaurants

my star rating based experience rather based food server ryan extremely prompt knowledgeable friendly meal good nothing amazing husband french toast egg benedict neither entree hotjust warm breakfast potato aka hash brown barely warm assume would remade dish said something really didnt want wait coffee weaklike coffee flavored water
the highlight meal definitely bacon thank ryan encouraging order thick cut glazed date syrup really good would even better hot
